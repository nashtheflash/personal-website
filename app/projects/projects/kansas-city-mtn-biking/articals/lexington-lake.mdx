<TLDR

## Access
Lexington Lake Park Shelter 1 provides the most direct access the trails. The gravel path at the north end of the lot leads out to the main gate and single track! There is tons of parking here and the lot is brand new!

## Trials
The trails at Lexington Lake can be road in either direction and are mostly easy. The Charcoal Loop is the shortest and easiest trail in the system. The Indigo Loop is my favorite trail. It rides fast out to the bluff where you will find some technical riding!

### The Bluff
The hardest terrain is along a bluff that runs along the north side of the system. It can get tight and rocky but the short steep descents are run and remind me of a roller coaster! Take the Indigo Loop and Emerald Loop to get out there!

<CallOut
title="Should I Ride The Bluff?"
text='YES! The north side of the system or the "bluff" can be challenging. However, the challenging sections are short and can be walked easily. I would recommend that beginners hit this trail but I would also plan on it taking longer that you might expect!'
/>

### Signs
The trails at Lexington Lake are very well marked and there are maps at almost every intersection. I was able to make a big loop through the entire system without any wrong turns the first time that I was out there!

### Summary
Lexington Lake offers opportunities to fish, rent kayaks, and run the cross country trails. If you are just getting into mountain biking, or taking someone that is new this is a great option! This is a great option for getting on the trails if you live in Lawrence or the western Kansas City metro.
