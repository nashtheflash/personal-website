# Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="Shawnee Mission Park is one of the biggest parks in Kansas City. There is tons of infrastructure that offers opportunity to hike, bike, and get out on the lake for water sports. The Mountain Biking is good but it's definitely chossy out there!"
/>

There is really only one place to park to access the trail system. You can get to the correct parking lot by following the signs that say "Mountain Bike Trails". It is a large lot. Park at the back to avoid the boat ramp and general lake traffic. You could park along the lake but I don't see any advantage!

From the parking lot you will see the East Trail Access point and the pump track. There is a bike pump, tools, and water fountain at this trailhead.

## Trail Overview
Shawnee Mission Park offers some great riding. I wouldn't bring a beginner here. I invited some of my long time friends out here who bike, but not regularly, and they got there butts kicked.

### Orange Loop
The Orange Loop is the easiest. There aren't many rocks, it's flat, and I can ride it fast. I would recommend starting here!

### Violet Loop
The Violet Loop is the hardest trail in the park. I wouldn't say there is anything dangerous, but there are a lot of rocks and the trail gets narrow. This is a hard trail to ride without dabbing.

### Gold Loop
The Gold Loop is my favorite ride in the system. Located in a ravine in the back corner of the mountain biking area. It has fast sections. It has rocky sections. What else could you want?

text='Shawnee Mission Park is a big park. There are miles of paved trails that start down south in Olathe and end at the bank of the Kansas River. I highly recommend exploring the other activities that park has to offer! The dog park is the best in the metro!'

## Kids
I don't have kids, but if I did I would turn them loose in the skills area. To access the skills area, park at the Outback Trailhead and ride back down the road. The entrance is under the power lines! The area consists of a flat path that runs in between the trees. If you don't have kids this section is not worth the visit.
