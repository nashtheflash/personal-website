<TLDR
text="Cedar Niles is one of my fravite spots in South Kansas City area. There is terrain for both new and more experienced riders. If you live in Olathe this is the place for an after work rip!"
/>

There are a two ways to access the trails at Cedar Niles, the 119th trailhead and the Clair Road trailhead. I always park at Clair road because it is the quicker way to access any given sections of the trail system. I would hit the Columbine Loop if it is your first visit. I prefer to ride the look counter clock wise but clockwise if fun too. It is a good representation of the area. If you are finding the ride easy I would add a lap on the Technical Loop and a lap on the Columbine Bypass.

## Columbine Bypass
Probably the best jump line in south Kansas City, the Columbine Bypass consists of three decent sized drops and a few small jumps to flat ground. The next closest jump line is probably at Nall Park!

text="Cedar Niles is easy riding and a great place to take a beginner. The Technical Loop is the only place that doesn't have ways to ride around the tougher terrain. The  jump line, Columbine Bypass, has easy ride around options for each jump."

If you have see the classic "bike leaning against and abandoned car" picture the Columbine Bypass is the location!

Cedar Niles is an awesome place to ride. There is traffic but it is not uncommon not to see anyone while your out there. If you are looking for something close that offers more of a challenge, I would check out Big Bull Creek Park!
