<TLDR
text="Kill Creek is a great spot to go if you are looking for some beginner terrain. Most of the trails are dirt with only a few rocks to deal with."
/>

Parking at the main lot is the fastest way to access the trails at Kill Creek and the only access point listed in this guide. However, you can access the trails quickly from about any of the parking lots throughout the park. I would start off by hitting the Green Loop. To get there, head north from the parking lot in the direction of the Prairie Observation Deck. You should see the deck, but right before the treeline you should also see some single track heading into the woods. That is the Green Loop Connector.

From there you can either get on Inner Hank, Outer Hank, or you can take the paved path to the Eddy Loop.

Inner Hank and Outer Hank offer some easy riding. The Eddy Loop is definitely harder.

## Eddy Loop
Probably the best jump line in south Kansas City, the Columbine Bypass consists of three decent sized drops and a few small jumps to flat ground. The next closest jump line is probably at Nall Park!

text="Cedar Niles is easy riding and a great place to take a beginner. The Technical Loop is the only place that doesn't have ways to ride around the tougher terrain. The  jump line, Columbine Bypass, has easy ride around options for each jump."

If you have see the classic "bike leaning against and abandoned car" picture the Columbine Bypass is the location!

Cedar Niles is an awesome place to ride. There is traffic but it is not uncommon not to see anyone while your out there. If you are looking for something close that offers more of a challenge, I would check out Big Bull Creek Park!
