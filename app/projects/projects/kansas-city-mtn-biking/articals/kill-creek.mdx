<TLDR
text="Kill Creek is a great spot to go if you are looking for some beginner terrain. Most of the trails are dirt, not steep, and most of the rocks can be ridden around"
/>

Parking at the Shelter 1 lot is the fastest way to access the trails at Kill Creek and the only access point listed in this guide. However, you can access the trails quickly from about any of the parking lots throughout the park.

I would start off by hitting Outer Hank. Head down the path in the direction of the woods. You will see the standard looking gate that will lead to the trails. Stay right at the first fork in the trail. You will pass by the Observation Deck on the way back into the woods.

Inner Hank and Outer Hank offer some easy riding. If you take Outer Hank far enough you can shoot down to the paved path and head south to get to the Eddy Loop. The Eddy Loop trail is definitely harder.

## Eddy Loop
This is the hardest riding in the park. Its funny because there are only a couple hard obstacles, but its a hard ride. It's sustained "kinda hard". Its easy to get off you're line and then your toast. Momentum is key to not dabbing on this trail. I'll be honest, I was dabbin it up! If you're riding with a buddy I would send him in first. I think this is trail is rarely rode and there are lost of spiders!

I did say there was only a couple of hard obstacles. There is a dried creek bed that is full of rocks. It's hard! The first time I say it I though I had lost the trail!

title="Horses / Hiking"
text={`Horses and Hikers are more common that you might think at this park. You will see trail makers that indicate 'Horses or Hikers Only". Please obey the signs. It seems stupid but riding up on a horse quickly is not cool! Most of the "Hiking Only" trails are on the south side of the lake and they wouldn't be fun to ride!`}

Kill Creek is a nice place to ride, but I would probably rather ride at Bull Creek or Cedar Niles if I was going to be in this part of the city. If there was more riding it would probably be more worth it! Hopefully we will see more development in the area!
