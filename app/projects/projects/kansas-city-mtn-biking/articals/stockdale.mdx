# Stockdale Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="Stockdale is small but packed with a lot of fun cool riding! There is an awesome jump line right by the parking lot!"
/>

## Access
The trails at Stockdale are accessed from the main parking lot. I was there on a Saturday and encountered a lot of traffic from frolfers, a horseshoe tournament and a pickup cricket game! Lots of stuff happening out there!

## Trails
Stockdale consists of one big loop and  couple of offshoots that are more difficult. I found the riding to be easy and I was able to ride the entire system in about an hour and that included walking back to the truck about half way through to fix a leaking tire! Be careful, some of the wood features have rotten away!

I really enjoyed the first technical offshoot! Great ledge riding!

text="I recommend tubeless tires and carrying a pump and dynaplugs to fix flat tires. While making this guide I only got one flat tire, and I think it was due to the age of the tire rather than a puncture."

You can find the tools I carry here: [My Bike Tools][1]. If you need something please use the link to support the project! If you don't need it don't buy it!

The trails run along side and through a frisbee golf course. Keep an eye out for frolfers. I was on the jump line when I accidentally rode through just as a guy was teeing off!

I have encountered a decent amount of hikers on the trails. I would defiantly keep an eye out for them. I had an unleashed pit bull come up to me aggressively. I recommend keeping some [bear spray][2] handy!
