<TLDR
text="Big Bull Creek is the gem of the south. There is some really good riding here if you are willing to make the drive!"
/>

## Access
Big Bull Creek only has one parking area. Once parked, ride across the bridge. You can go either right or left to access the Horseshoe Loop. Going left is my preference because there are some small jumps. The right side is slightly more technical with no jumps.

title="Ride Counter Clockwise"
text="Riding both directions is fun, but I prefer riding counter clockwise! There are a lot of Y's on this system. All you have to remember is to stay left!"
/>

## Trails
The trails at Big Bull Creek tend to be easier close to the trailhead and get harder toward the back of the system. I have listed all of the trails as XC trails but there are some small jumps on the Quarry Loop. I recommend riding the Quarry Loop first, going left at every Y that you come across. That way you will hit the entire system!

title="Excellent Infrastructure"
text='The amenities at Big Bull Park are second to none. There are beautiful bathrooms, awesome playgrounds, and well maintained trails. I guess that is the intermodule money at work!'

Big Bull Creek is an awesome system to ride if you are looking for mostly flat cross country trails. It would be awesome if there was a jump line developed out here in the future.
