<TLDR
text="Cedar Niles is one of my fravite spots in South Kansas City area. There is terrain for both new and more experienced riders. If you live in Olathe this is the place for an after work rip!"
/>

There are a two ways to access the trails at Cedar Niles, the 119th trailhead and the Clair Road trailhead. I always park at Clair road because it is the quicker way to access any given sections of the trail system. I would hit the Columbine Loop if it is your first visit. It is a good representation of the area. If you are finding the ride easy I would add a lap on the Technical Loop and a lap on the Columbine Bypass.

If you have see the classic "bike leaning against and abandoned car" picture the Columbine Bypass is the location!
