The AI email feature that ZoomInfo offers leaves something to be desired. Lets jump right into some of the examples.

Out of the box, here are some example responses.


## Day One
Got on the call, and it was apparent that the lady was more knowledgable then the previous contacts. She mainly wanted to connect accounts to ZoomInfo which I had already completed. She then was looking into setting up the WebSights feature(Read: <LinkNewTab text='ZoomInfo WebSights Review' link='/blog/business/zoom-info/websights-review'/>). While this is a valuable feature, it is going to take our web guy to get that setup. I wanted to walk through a mock sales interaction using intent(Read: <LinkNewTab text='ZoomInfo Intent Review' link='/blog/business/zoom-info/intent-review'/>). What I mean by that is:
1. Find companies that are searching for us
2. Do a small amount of research on the company
3. Send the appropriate person at the company an email

To me, that is a very straight forward ask....

### Find Companies Looking For Our Services
ZoomInfo lingo for this is **Intent**. To look at intent, you will go to the Intent page. The intent page can be reached by using the top navigation bar.

The intent page is basically a big list of companies that are searching for your product that can, and should, be filtered down. Step one, find companies looking for your serves, is easily acomplished. Once on the page, you are bonmarded with a long list of prospects. I had around 9k. Sounds great! I added some simple filters to widdle the list down to only companies that are based in the United States.

Doing a small amount of research was, at face value, easy. You can easily see the location, estimated yearly revenue, and contacts that are in the company. When I started clicking on the link to the companies websites is where I started to run into issues. Most of the links, 3 out of 5, were not linking to the company website. They were just going to 404 pages. At face value, not a huge issue, but it actually is. The only thing that I am buying from ZoomInfo is data. If that data is bad, then that is an issue. If I find one piece of bad data, how can I assume the majority of the data is actually correct? After going back and forth with the ZoomInfo product expert for a few minutes on this, I decided to move on, but was never given a satisfactory answer. After some more searching, I was able to find a company that looked like a good fit for our services.

I wanted to send them an email. This is made easy by ZoomInfo not only giving you the contact information for many contacts, they claim all contacts, at the company. To sum up this section, the AI emails are not good. They're actually awful, in my opinion unusable.
