<TLDR
text="Hodge Park is just plain fun. It has easy trails that ride fast. It was fun to fly through the woods for a couple hours!"
/>

There are a two ways to access the trails at Hodge Park, the Hodge Park Athletic Field trailhead and the Shoal Creek Museum trailhead. I would recommend parking by the athletic field instead of the museum unless you are with a beginner. If you park at the athletic field, ride across the bridge and in about 100 yards you will see the trail entrance on the right.

Other than the Field Loop, which is very easy, all of the trails at Hodge Park are about the same difficulty. If you are a complete beginner you might have to walk your bike through a few rock sections, but otherwise it is easy riding. The trails ride fast and are a lot of fun!

## Bandwagon

Lots of twists and turns on this fast riding trail. There aren't any jumps or big features but the twists and turns are awesome! I would ride this trail from north to south.

## Trail Markings
The trails are very well marked at Hodge Park. They are color coordinated, with all of the connector tails marked with white diamonds. If you make a turn and there isn't a sign, you are probably going down a game trail!

## The Perfect Route
The Perfect Route is my recommendation for someone that wants to hit the most trails in the least amount of time.

1. Clockwise on Twisted Branch
2. First turnoff on Farmtastic
3. Don't take the turnoff to the trailhead
4. Straight onto Bandwagon
5. Ride Buffalo Trace
6. Turn onto the Field loop and ride clockwise.
7. Merge onto Buffalo Trace for a short ride back to the pavement

This is my own creation and in no way an officially sanctioned route.

## Shoal Creek Living History Museum 
Is a park with some old buildings and buffalo. There are events that take place out here from time to time. If you are out riding I recommend taking a lap around the town! If its your first time starting from the museum, it might be hard to find the trail because it is not well defined. The entrance is the photo below and it is behind building 19!

## Take a Date
At the time of writing, I am a 27 year old single dude and I am always on the lookout for date spots. If I was going on a mountain bike date this is where I would go. Start by ridding around the old town. If things look good hit the farm loop. If she looks like she can handle more, jump on Buffalo Trace! This gives plenty of opportunity to warm up on the bike and see what kind of rider she is. You also have the option to stay on the Field Loop which is basically just riding through an open field but still feel like you're "mountain biking".
