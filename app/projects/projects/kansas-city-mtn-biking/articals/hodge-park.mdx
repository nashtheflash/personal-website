# Hodge Park Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="Hodge Park is just plain fun. It has easy trails that ride fast. It was fun to fly through the woods for a couple hours!"
/>

There are a two ways to access the trails at Hodge Park, the Hodge Park Athletic Field trailhead and the Shoal Creek Museum trailhead. I would recommend parking by the athletic field instead of the museum unless you are with a beginner. 

Other than the Field Loop, which is very easy, all of the trails at Hodge Park are about the same difficulty. I think that Bandwaggon is my favorite section. The trails ride fast and are a lot of fun!

### The Perfect Route
The Perfect Route is my recommendation for someone that wants to hit the most trails in the least amount of time.

1. Clockwise on Twisted Branch
2. First turnoff on Farmtastic
3. Don't take the turnoff to the trailhead
4. Straight onto Bandwagon
5. Ride Buffalo Trace
6. Turn onto the Field loop and ride clockwise.
7. Merge onto Buffalo Trace for a short ride back to the pavement

This is my own creation and in no way an officially sanctioned route.

title="New Additions!"
text='Cedar Niles is adding more and more trails to the system. Currently the new section of trail is unnamed. I am calling it "The Annex". The new trails can be accessed the fastest by parking at the 119th Street trailhead and turning right after the bridge. Climb the paved hill and you will see the trail entrance on the right!'

## Columbine Bypass
Probably the best jump line in south Kansas City, the Columbine Bypass consists of three decent sized drops and a few small jumps to flat ground. The next closest jump line is probably at Nall Park!

If you have see the classic "bike leaning against and abandoned car" picture the west entrance to the Columbine Bypass is the location!

Cedar Niles is an awesome place to ride. There is traffic but it is not uncommon not to see anyone while your out there. If you are looking for something close that offers more of a challenge, I would check out Big Bull Creek Park!
