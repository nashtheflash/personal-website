<TLDR
text='Hidden Valley Park is a great place for new riders. All of the trails are easy and the entire system can easily be ridden in about 30 minutes. This is not a "Musty Ride" for the experienced crowd.'
/>

## Access
All of the activities at Hidden Valley Park start at the same trailhead. Once you park, go back down the access road and you will see the single track going back into the woods.

<CallOut
title="New Additions!"
text='Cedar Niles is adding more and more trails to the system. Currently the new section of trail is unnamed. I am calling it "The Annex". The new trails can be accessed the fastest by parking at the 119th Street trailhead and turning right after the bridge. Climb the paved hill and you will see the trail entrance on the right!'

## Trails
There is one big loop, Cool Ranch, with one shortcut, Blue Cheese, and one other small loop, Zesty. I think Cool Ranch has the best riding. I prefer to ride the look clockwise because there is on bank on a downhill that you can send at full speed. So fun!!

One of the smaller systems in Kansas City which makes it a great options for new riders. I ran into a 34 year old lady on her first mountain bike ride. She was laughing, joking, and having a great time! More experienced riders might get board fast here.
