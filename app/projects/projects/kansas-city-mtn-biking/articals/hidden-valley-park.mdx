<TLDR
text='Hidden Valley Park is a great place for new riders. All of the trails are easy and the entire system can easily be ridden in about 30 minutes. This is not a "Musty Ride" for the experienced crowd.'
/>

## Access
All of the activities at Hidden Valley Park start at the same trailhead. Once you park, go back down the access road and you will see the single track going across the field.

## Trails
There is one big loop, Cool Ranch, with one shortcut, Blue Cheese, and one other small loop, Zesty. I think Cool Ranch has the best riding. I prefer to ride the look clockwise because there is on bank on a downhill that you can send at full speed. So fun!!

One of the smaller systems in Kansas City which makes it a great options for new riders. I ran into a 34 year old lady on her first mountain bike ride. She was laughing, joking, and having a great time! More experienced riders might get board fast here.
