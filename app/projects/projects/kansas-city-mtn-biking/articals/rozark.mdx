# Rozarks Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="Rozarks consists of two separate trail systems that are a 5 minute ride apart. Both areas are small and probably not worth a special trip. If you are local to the area it is worth checking out!"
/>

## Rozarks West
To access the trails you have two options Fisher Park and the Rosedale Memorial Arch parking lot. The trail system seems to ride the best if you are starting at the arch lot! 

The first thing that you will notice is that the trail goes everywhere with little rhyme or reason. There are arrows posted on some trees that have colors that correspond to the trail map, but these are few and far between.

Most of the trail seems to be called Marty's Woods. There are cutoffs, Y's, forks, and everything else that you can imagine. I did my best to add the trails in the map below. However, I prefer just picking a line on the fly. You are never far from the car and it would be hard, if not impossible, to get lost! 


### Pump Pit
The pump pit is marked on most of the trail maps. When I visited it was beat down.

### Mission Cliff's Trail
If you start at Fisher Park and stay left. You will ride around the power substation and eventually find yourself at a road. If you look across you will see a trail sign that says Mission Cliff's Trail.

I went about 100 yards up the tail and stumbled across some dudes that didn't look happy to see me. They started making a lot of noise, banging metal. I don't really know what they were doing but I turned around. The trail was very overground and I was having to lean down on the bike in order not to hit branches with my head. It's on the map below but I would skip this one!

However, I didn't every feel like I was in danger. Would I tell my 5'2" little sister to bike here alone? Probably not...`}

## The 39th Street Drive
If you are at the Fisher Park trailhead you can turn left onto 39th street and it is pretty much a straight shot to Rozarks East. The ride over to the other park is a good time to look for a place to grab a post ride beer or food!

## Rozarks East

If you are parking at this side of the system I would park at the community center, then ride over to the trails.

The east trail system is small and not a "must ride". Most of the trails run along the bluff that forms a barrier on the west side of the park. I found that the trails started midway up the staircase next to the tennis courts. From there you can take the high line or low line. I think the low line is more fun!

text={`Kansas is not steep but there are sections at both trail systems but especially so at Rozarks West. Colorado steep? No, but short and steep non the less!`}

I did find more signs of a homeless population at this park.
