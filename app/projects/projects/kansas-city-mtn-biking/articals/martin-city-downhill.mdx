<TLDR
text="The Martin City Downhill is the best downhill area in Kansas City. The riding ranges from easy to big jumps with 15' gaps. Get the feel of the trails before hitting the features. Some lines are more maintained than others."

text='The Martin City Downhill and Swope Park areas bookend the larger Blue River Parkway trail system. They are separated from the larger system because of specific access details, area focuses, and local banter.'

## Access
Accessing the Martin City Downhill area is confusing and can lead to you being towed or ticketed! Do NOT park at the yellow gate immediately outside of the trail head. If you look on Google Maps, you may think it's a ball field, it's not. They have been removed by the city.

### DO NOT PARK HERE!

### Browns Athletic Field Access
This is the recommended way to access the trails. Park at the athletic fields, ride your bike across the street. You will ride east on Blue Ridge Boulevard. Ride over the bridge and you will see the trail entrance on the south side of the road. The downside is the long approach, 2 miles, to the downhill area. Hopefully better parking will open in the future!

### 139th Street Access
Parking at 139th street is not official parking. It is a pull off on the side of the road that can fit about 4 or 5 cars. I frequently see people there. I park there if I have a limited amount of time to ride. This is defiantly a "park at your own risk" situation!

title="New Area"
text='The Martin City Downhill was opened in September 2023. It is the newest addition to the Blue River Parkway trail system and probably one of the newest additions to the Kansas City Trail system as a whole!'

## Trails
This system is well documented! Here is the official map!

UPnAT'EM is the trail that will take you up to the main hub. From the hub you have the options to take Jack Burton or Truffle Shuffle Down. 

<CenteredImage image={downhillHub} altText={'Martin City Downhill Hub'} title={'Downhill Hub'} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

I really enjoyed riding Jack Burton. It has some great berms, low consequence jumps, and its fast to get back to the top for another lap!

This is the only true downhill area in Kansas City. Pay attention to the trail signs! Most trails can only be ridden one way!
