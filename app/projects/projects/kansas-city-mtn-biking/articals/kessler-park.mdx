# Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="Once the Kansas City mountain biking Mecca, Kessler Park contains some of the largest cliffs in the area. There are portions of the single track that expose the rider to 100' falls. There is also a large homeless population that call this park home. Some of the trails have become rundown or non-existent."
/>

## Access
The main way to access this trail system is from the west gate where Cliff Drive begins. If you park near the gate you will see the trails leading off into the woods to the right.

<TwoCenteredImages image={[parking, trailEntrance]} altText={['West Trailhead', 'Trail Entrance']} titles={['West Trailhead', 'Trail Entrance']} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

I also marked a good place to access the part of the system with jumps, but you could park on the east end of Cliff Drive and ride in as well.

<CallOut
title="Don't Ride Kessler Park"
text='This place sucks. I hate riding through homeless camps and being worried about stepping on needles. There is trash everywhere and the place stinks. I considered omitting this trail system from the guide but decided against it for historical purposes and to warn riders.'
/>

## Trails
The trails are fun to ride but you have to be okay with some exposure. Everybody has a different risk tolerance. I was defiantly paying attention and moving slower than normal while riding the trail, but wasn't to nervous. There are a few "No fall zones" but the riding is easy. Exposure is why the Kessler Park Trail is marked as expert!

<TwoCenteredImages image={[trail3, trail5]} altText={['Kessler Park Typical Terrain', 'Kessler Park Only Trail Sign']} titles={['Typical Terrain', 'Only Trail Sign']} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

Most of the trails are hard to find. I didn't see any signage in the system. Some of the trails seemed to abruptly end or disappear. I would get the gpx files or plan on a lot of route finding if I was heading out there!

<CallOut
title="Racing On The Cliff"
text="While on a West Bottom Bicycles group ride that went down the paved Cliff Drive Road, I got to talking with an old timer that used to participate in enduro races on the Cliffs in the 80's and 90's. Pretty wild stuff. I wouldn't be racing up there!"

## Jump Park
There is a jump park in the system. It is located right by the Kansas City Museum. The jumps are big and in pretty good shape. This is also one of the cleaner sections of the park. If I lived nearby, I would be ridding here. Keep in mind there is a homeless camp 500 feet down the trail.

## Safety
This is a rough area. It is defiantly making a comeback but you have to be ready to encounter all types of people in all types of mental state. While riding the trails I was asked for money and rode through 2 permanent looking homeless camps. I also saw needles, bullet casings, trash, and drugs. I wouldn't take kids here and honestly I just hate riding in areas like this. It only takes one bad encounter with someone on drugs to change your life. I rode alone and was fine but would have felt way better with a buddy.

I would leave your car empty. I park by Happy Gillis in Columbus park and ride into the park from Dora St.

## Drugs
You really shouldn't do drugs, but if your going to, I found some good bolted crack on Cliff Drive.

## Cliff Drive / Gladstone Blvd.
Cliff Drive, the paved road, has been closed to cars for some time now. Even though I have said not negative things about the park, I try to run and bike the road as much as possible. It is clean and the homeless stay off of it. I see women walking there dogs down the road all the time. Just know, with it being closed, you may be more "alone" than you thought you would be and there is a 100' cliff between you and the road. Gladstone Blvd. is awesome. The houses are some of the coolest in Kansas City. I highly recommend walking or riding down the road. There are passing cars and it feels a lot less "remote" than Cliff Drive.

## Goats
The camper on Cliff Drive belongs to the goats. The city is using the little guys to clean up the area. I went back and looked at some of their previous work and it is second to non!
