<TLDR
text="Nall Park is small. It's more of a jump line than a trail system. If you aren't looking for jumps, I would ride somewhere else!"
/>

To access the trails you will want to park in the far east side of the Roeland Park Community Center(see access section below). After parking you should be able to find the entrance to Master Blaster and Beyond Thunderdome.

<TwoCenteredImages image={[masterBlaster, beyondThunderdome]} altText={['Master Blaster Trail Sign', 'Beyond Thunderdome trail sign']} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

You have to enter one of the two trails. Both are easy, Beyond Thunderdome is less steap. The first sections of both trails are just there to get down to the jump line. There isn't a reason to ride back up to the parking lot.

Ropoflo aka "the jump line" is the main attraction and runs through the middle of the system. It is a one way trail. To get back up, ride Aunty Entity back to the top of the ravine and then take master blaster back to the drop in point.

The only other trail is the other half of Beyond Thunderdome. It is okay. Worth riding once!
