# Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="MoPac single track is a small trail system that is hard to get to, but has one of my favorite tech trails in Kansas City!"
/>

## Access
There is only one trailhead for mountain biking at MoPac. Drive though the gate and park by the shelter. You will see the trailhead on the opposite side of the road!

## Trails
There isn't much trail, but the trail that is here is good. I recommend Blood, Sweat, and Ticks. It is probably my favorite tech trails in the Kansas City area. I also enjoyed the Lake Shore Drive. The trail extends around the lake but the west side is not marked on the map at the trailhead!

There is a jump line in the park that can be accessed from KAM or more directly via Lake Shore Drive!

text="The Ol' Dusty Trail and the west side of the Lake Shore loop is not listed on the main trail map but is included in this guide to complete the loop back to the trailhead. Nobody likes a loop that doesn't loop!"

Ol' Dusty is called that for a reason! Here is the west LakeShore Drive Trailhead. Look at all that dust!!

If I had limited time to knock out all the riding at MoPac, I would ride KAM out to the main trail junction. Once at the junction, take Sasquatch Crossing to the far end of the system. If you hit the bridge you missed the cutoff and need to turn around! Take Blood, Sweat, and Ticks back to the main junction. It's Lake Shore Drive all the way back to the trailhead!

There are full blown campsites with electrical hookups at this park. I don't know if there is enough riding to keep you busy for an entire weekend but thats just me! Fishing, kayaking, and frisbee golf are also available at the park.
