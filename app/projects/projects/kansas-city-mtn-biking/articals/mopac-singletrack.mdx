# Mopac Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="MoPac single track is a small trail system that is hard to get to, but has one of my favorite tech trails in Kansas City!"
/>

## Access
There is only one trailhead for mountain biking at MoPac. If you park by the shelter, you will see the trailhead on the opposite side of the road!

## Trails
There isn't much trail here but that dosn't mean that its not good. I recommend Blood, Sweat, and Ticks. It is probably my favorite tech trails in the Kansas City area. I also enjoyed the Lake Shore trail. The trail extends around the lake but it is not marked on the map at the trailhead!

text='The Ol Dusty Trail is not listed on the main trail map but is included in this guide to complete the loop back to the trailhead. Nobody likes a loop that doesn't loop!'

If I had limited time to knock out all the riding at MoPac, I would ride KAM out to the main trail jumction. Once at the junction, take Sasquatch Crossing to the far end of the system. If you hit the bridge you missed the cutoff and need to turn around! Take Blood, Sweat, and Ticks back to the main junction. Its Lake shore all the way back to the trailhead!

There are full blown campsites with electrical hookups at this park. I don't know if there is enough riding to keep you busy for an entire weekend but thats just me! Fishing, kayaking, and frisbee golf are also available at the park.
