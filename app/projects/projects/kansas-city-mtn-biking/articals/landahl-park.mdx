# Digital Guide Book
<TLDR
text="Landahl is one of the largest and all around best places to ride in Kansas City. You will find everything from easy single track to challenging tech and probably the best downhill trail in the city! You haven't rode Kansas City until you ride this park!"
/>

## Access
Technically there are two 2 trailheads that you can use to enter the park, but I have only seen people parking at the Argo Road Trailhead. There is plenty of parking and there is a main trail junction 100' past the concrete blocks.

## Trails
There is a lot of riding at Landahl. Here is the trail Map:
<CenteredImage image={map} altText={'Landahl Mountain Bike Trail Map'} title={'Full Map'} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

Some of the trails at Landahl are long and go way back into the woods. You will find yourself at times a few miles away from the trailhead, providing a remote feeling that is hard to find in Kansas City. One thing that you will notice pretty quickly is that the rock quality at this park is amazing for the area. Riding though the rocks is very common and rock shoots are found on most tech trails. Really cool stuff!

Here is a cool formation found on Scott's Gunbarrel:

### Difficulty Rating
I think that the difficulty is a little overblown. As a rule of thumb, I think that you could ride one level higher here then your used to. Here is my summation of the difficulty rating:
* __Easy ->__ My mom can go down these. Think riding though a field. 
* __Challenging ->__ This would be listed as easy at most of the parks in Kansas City.
* __Difficult ->__ Would be listed at challenging at most of the parks in the city.
* __Very Difficult ->__ Hard but honestly not that bad. If you fall you might eat some rock though.
* __Expert Only ->__ Big Jumps

### Will's Wanderer
If you are into warming up then this would be a great option. It's right inside the park and ends right in the center of the park.

### Rim Job
A must ride and probably the most well known trail at Landahl if not Kansas City. The trail runs along this rock rim type formation. There are some really fun moves on this trail. If you like tech, this is as good as it gets in the area!
<CenteredImage image={rim1} altText={'Landahl Mountain Bike Trail Map'} title={'Full Map'} width={'640'} height={'640'} />

### The ISH
The best jump line in the Kansas City area. There are some big sends out here. Riding the double track from the trailhead is the quickest way out here!
<CenteredImage image={theISH} altText={'Landahl Mountain Bike Trail Map'} title={'Full Map'} width={'640'} height={'640'} />

### Adam's Family
I loved this trail. Weaving through the rocks made for some awesome riding. If you are on the fence about riding Rim Job I would see how this one goes. If you had fun on Adam's Family you will be ready for a Rim Job(had to at some point haha).

### 10 / 11 Loop
It doesn't look like this section gets much riding but is awesome! This is probably the most "remote" riding in Kansas City. There was a lot of blow down on the connector trail and the loop itself! Most of it can be navigated but I had to carry my bike a few times! The Turkey Trail is an offshoot on the backside of the loop. It is "rideable" but you will be climbing over some massive blow down with your bike. Some route finding may be necessary, sometimes I was wondering if I was still on the trail!

### Tasty Goodness / Worm
I need to get some beta here because i did not ride these.
<CenteredImage image={tasty1} altText={'Landahl Mountain Bike Trail Map'} title={'Full Map'} width={'640'} height={'640'} />

Landahl is probably the best and largest bike parks in the city. It is my go to for some weekend riding and I can't recommend this place enough!
