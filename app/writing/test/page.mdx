I went to Barret Jackson, the biggest car auction in the world, this weekend in Arizona. Auctions of any kind are electric but this one was especially interesting. Cars would go for one or two hundred thousand while a sea of people that could barely make rent looked on.

That sea contained many creatures. Overweight men dressed in hyper masculine clothes with hands as smooth as a babies. Tan skinned women with big lips. Young men dreaming about the cars they wish were in their garage. The most common of all were the average men.

The average man was probably 55. They had some gray hair left
