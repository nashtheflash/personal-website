# The Window in the Woods

I woke up for the final time, greeted by cold that had finally crept into the cabin. I’d been up around midnight to feed the stove but made no further deposits. I let it burn out. It was time to leave.

It is an Alaskan tradition to clean the stove and pack it with wood so the next man need only spark it with a lighter. You never know what hardships might befall him, or what condition he’ll be in when he arrives. I piled the crispy remains of my fire into an old metal box and swept the floor into a pile by the door, readying it for its final sweep. I felt the pores on my face tighten as they were hit by the icy February air. I looked out onto a dark forest unlike what you might find outside the Arctic Circle. There were trees, but few survived this far north. Most of the landscape was tundra. I made the final sweep and retreated to pack my gear and get dressed.

I clicked my watch at 4:03 a.m. and started skiing. It was 11 miles back to the truck that had been sitting dormant for five days. Luckily, this trip would be lighter. I pulled a sled out—which I will never do again—that had been packed to the brim with all kinds of extra food in heavy containers and luxury items. Think cans of beans, two full blocks of Costco butter, journals, and books. Pure insanity. Most of the food was eaten, and what wasn’t was left. I surveyed the cabin one last time. I looked at the two big blocks of butter sitting on the windowsill above the stove. I laughed and walked out the door.

While skiing, my mind drifted to my truck. Hopefully, it would start. Hopefully, it hadn’t been broken into. It’s a piece of shit, which is my first deterrent to the few but determined thieves. I’d also left a handle of R&R on the hood as a peace offering, which is customary. The Eskimos prefer beer, but it’s too fucking cold for beer to sit outside this time of year.

The terrain is gradual. I was on XC skis but wished I had brought my more hardy BC skis, which also feature warmer boots. You ski across a valley, and whether you are going out to the cabin or back to the trailhead, you ski downhill first, then climb second. It looks like a V on my watch. The lighter sled was much better, and I made great time getting to the trailhead. I was on the final uphill when I saw a face peek over the horizon.

“Hey!”

I skied up and surveyed the group.

“Hi,” I followed.

“Were you out at the cabin?” the scrawny guy asked.

“Uhh, yea?” I answered.

“How’s the trail?”

There were four of them—two men, two women—all around 35. The two women were dressed in leotards and tutus. It was one of their birthdays. A funny sight to see in the middle of nowhere. Normally, this would cause me to scoff at the unpreparedness, but whether it was their beat-up gear or their carefree attitude, I could tell they’d be fine. The other, non-scrawny man would also be fine. I could tell he was annoyed by the questions the scrawny dude was asking. He looked on while skinning his skis with a stern, scarred face, a cigarette hanging from his mouth, and a torn jacket. He looked like he had just wiggled out of a fishing boat. I could tell the scrawny man had feelings for one of the women and had been dragged along to hang with the girl’s friend.

“It’s good, easy to follow, almost seems groomed in spots,” I said.

“Ohh, good! Do you think these are good skis?” he asked, producing an old ski with BC bindings.

The whole time he was moving around—he couldn’t stand still—running in circles around the car. I could see the other dude wasn’t looking forward to staying in a cabin with this guy.

“I think they’ll be fine! The first four miles are downhill. It’ll go fast.”

“Ohh, great, great.”

At this point, I was on the other side—the driver’s side—of the truck. The R&R was no longer on the hood. I was changing into my boots as the man rounded the corner of my door and started to whisper to me.

“Hey, it’s one of the girl’s birthdays.”

“Ohh, nice.”

“Okay, so, I brought five pounds of crab.”

He stared at me. At a pullout 100 miles north of Fairbanks, I stood staring at the man, him back at me. This went on for ten seconds.

“Okay?”

“Okay, so yeah, unfortunate—I forgot the butter. You wouldn’t happen to have any would you?”
