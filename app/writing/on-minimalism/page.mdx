# On Minimalism

Minimalism is just another market segment that marketers are trying to put you in. Minimalist might not buy as many things, but have you noticed that most of the minimalist influencers seem to have very nice and high quality things? Don't be a part of a segment.

Minimalism, like anything, is only worth it if you are able to sustain the lifestyle for and extended period of time. Not ten day or months but ten years. Becoming a minimalist for a few days is probably harmful. I don't think the minimalism that is portrayed by most people on social media is that. 

People were just as happy in every part in human history as there are now. This proves that ignorance is bliss. Yes there have been bad periods, but this is a general fact. A middle class person in Egypt, barring war or plague or other external hardship is just as happy as the middle class in ancient Rome or today American, even thought they did not have a coliseum or any of the modern conveniences that we do. The only reason we think there things make us happy is because we have been told that they do and all of the people around us think that the conveniences are a requirement to live life.

There is a scene in the Amazing Mr. Ripely where they are talking about getting a refrigerator for the first time. They characters were high class and could afford one. The spoke about how it was expensive but then they wouldn't need to go to the market every day. It seemed like an expensive price for something that promotes isolationism, an increased payment to the electricity provider, and the eating of less fresh food. However some marketing dude is some cube in some far off city says is a necessity. So they bought it.

## A Good Life
I want to live well not minimal. The market segment somewhat aligns with this idea. Having less things and consuming less promotes a simpler life. However they are the root of a simpler life, the tree must still grow. The good life consists of the following:

* Low overhead
* Access to community
* Access to public utilities
* Access to commerce

This allows maximum creativity, freedom, and living. You want to both contribute and take advantage of what society offers, but remain sceptical. The ability to reject commonly accepted ideas is of the utmost importance.

## Where To Live
You want to find a city that can be exploited. This isn't malicious. It is also an ever moving target. A city that can be exploited today might not be ripe for the taking tomorrow.

### The case again moving to a cabin in the woods
Thoreau is frequently quoted but the most important paragraph in Walden is always left out. This is the last paragraph of the book:

Thus was my first yearâ€™s life in the woods completed; and the
second year was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6
th,1847.

Humans are not designed to be stagnant, we need to be stimulated. The same monotony and lack of community is not the answer, even for the loudest evangelizer.

### How Cities Exploit There Inhabitance.
While traveling around the country working for Kiewit, I noticed something interesting. Society is designed to find the money and take it. It doesn't matter where is shows up. An example:

I was told that I was going to be moving to Cameron, Louisiana, a move I eventually rejected, and I started looking for a place to rent. I found this town to be in the middle of nowhere but any room for rent was priced exactly at 1/3 of my take home pay. I wounder how the landlords came to the exact number.

I noticed the same thing when I lived in Kansas City. All of the nice apartments that looked alike, I'm assuming they are all owned buy private equity, are priced at about 1/3 the take home pay of someone making about $80k per year. It's almost as if the PE firm came into town, found an area where enough people made $80k per year, then constructed apartments that would run at a 8% cap rate renting to those folks at 1/3 there take home pay. Instead of making highest value units possible and renting them at the lowest price.

Most apparent in housing, but exists in everything from restaurants and apparel to groceries.

I want to be clear that I am a capitalist. I have no issue with this shrewd business practice, but I am not going to participate. I want to keep the monthly housing cost far below the 1/3 mark and so should you!

### How to Exploit a City?
Living in a city solely because you were born there is retarded. The only reason to stay is if the city happens to be exploitable or your connections lead to some competitive advantage that makes the situation exploitable. Knowing smart / rich / business owners is great but that is not to say that having a mom to help with the cost of child care isn't just as valuable, if not more so.

You want to find a city that has an imbalance in the value you get from living there vs what you pay. Once you get there it is important that you extract the grain while leaving the chaff. All social expectations must be questioned. Exploding a city doesn't mean that you are taking from someone else. Here are a few things that can cause the imbalance:
 
* Affordable food, water, utilities, housing and other necessities
* You have family in the city
* Plenty of green ways and parks
* bikable
* city services such as snow removal and Police/Fire Protection
* Public libraries
* Opportunity's to make money
* Community events
* Culture. You are who you hang around
* Close proximity to nature and offers opportunities to enjoy it
* Enough natural resources, think clean water, for now and the foreseeable future
* Acceptable growing season.

All of the above can make a city a good value. You want to get what you pay for! Each city has a different mix of each. Lets look at a couple.

Minneapolis, Minnesota during the George Floyed Extended news cycle
This was the most disgusting breakdown of the cost / benefit ratio that I have ever seen. When you own real estate you pay additional taxes. This isn't for fun, this is because you are using additional cit services. One of those services is protection. If the city decides it is okay for people to burn down your real estate, it is not longer viable to live in that city even though it ranks high on most of the other examples above. If the city govenment stops providing services that people are paying for, it is only a matter of time before you are effected.

Rapid City, South Dakota

Kansas City, Kansas
