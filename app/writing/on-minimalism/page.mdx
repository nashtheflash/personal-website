# On Minimalism

Minimalim is just anyther market segment that marketers are trying to put you in. Minimalist might not buy as many things, but have you noticed that most of the minimalist influencers seem to have very nice and high quality things? Don't be a part of a segement.


Minimalim, like anything, is only worth it if you are able to sustain the lifestyle for and extended period of time. Not ten day or months but ten years. I don't think the minimalisum that is potrais buy most people on social media is that. Moving out to the middle of nowhere is romantic, but most likely not the right answer for most people.

Always remember that people were just as happy in every part in human history as there are now. Yes there have been bad periods, but this is a general fact. A middle class person in egypt, barring war or plauge or other external hardship is just as happy as the middle class American today, even thought they did not have all of the modern conveniences that we do. The only reason we think there things make us happy is becuse we have been told that they do.

There is a scene in the Amazing Mr. Riply where they are talking about getting a refrigerator for the first time. They characters were high class and could afford one. The spoke about how it was expensive but then they wouldn't need to go to the market every day. It seemed like an expensive price for something that promotes isolationism, an increased payment to the electricity provider, and the eating of less fresh food. However some marketing dude is some cube in some far off city says is a nessecity. So they bought it.

## A Good Life
I want to live well not minimal. The market segment somewhat aligns with this idea. Having less things and consuming less promotes a simpler life. However they are the root of a simpler life, the tree must still grow. The good life consits of the following:

1. Low overhead
1. access to community
1. access to public utilities
1. access to commerce

This allows maximum creativity, freedom, and living. You want to take advantage of what society offers, but remain sceptical. The ability to reject commonly accepted ideas is of the utmost importance.

## Where To Live
You want to find a city that can be exploited. This isn't malicious. It is also an ever moving target. A city that can be exploited today might not be ripe for the taking tomorrow.

### The case agains moving to a cabin in the woods
Throue is frequently quoted but the most important paragrph in Walden is always left out. This is the last paragraph of the book:

Thus was my first yearâ€™s life in the woods completed; and the
second year was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6
th,1847.

Humans are not desiged to be stagnant, we need to be stimulated. The same monoteny and lack of community is not the answer, even for the loudest evangelizer.

### How Cities Exploit
Remember, you are constantly being segmented by some algorithm or some dude in a cube somewhere. While traveling around the country working for Kiewit, I noticed something interesting. Society is designed to find the money and take it. It doesn't matter where is shows up. An example:

I was told that I was going to be moving to Cameron, Louisiana, a move I eventually rejected, and I started looking for a place to rent. I found this town to be in the middle of nowhere but any room for rent was priced exactly at 1/3 of my take home pay. I wounder how the landlords came to the exact number.

I noticed the same thing when I lived in Kansas City. All of the nice apartments that looked alike, I'm assuming they are all owned buy private equity, are priced at about 1/3 the take home pay of someone making about $80k per year. It's almost as if the PE firm came into town, found out how many people made $80k per year, then constructed apartments that would run at a 8% cap rate renting to those folks at 1/3 there take home pay. Instead of making highest value units possible.

I want to be clear that I am a capitalist. I have no issue with this shrewd business practice, but I am not going to participate. I want to keep the monthly housing cost far below the 1/3 mark and so should you!

### How to Exploit a City?
You want to find a city that has an imbalance in the value you get from living there vs what you pay. Once you get there is is important that you extrct the grain while leaving the chaf. All social expectations must be questioned. Exploding a city doesn't mean that you are taking them from someone else. It's like buying a car. You want to get a good deal, Here are a few things that can cause the imbalance:
 
1. You have family in the city
1. The city offers greenways and is easly bikable
1. the city offers services such as snow removal 
1. the city has adiquat police and fire protection
1. the city has public libraries
1. the city offers afortable food and other necesities
1. the city has opertunitys to make money
1. the city has comminity events
1. the city has culture. You are who you hang around
3. the city is close to nature and offers opertinites to enjoy it
1. there city has enough natural recources, think clean water, for now and the forseeble future
1. a acceptable growing season.

All of the above can make a city a good value. You want to get what you pay for! Each city has a different mix of each. Lets look at a couple.
