This is how I setup my Tune M1. My idea was to have a system that is compartmentalized. This means that my truck/camper is closer to a large backpack than a camper. I also decided that there are two main modes: Traveling and Daily Driver. These modes will be referenced in the rest of this article! This setup is great for one person or a couple. I find that the Tune is not ideal for more than one single person or a couple. It gets small fast and gear storage for more than two people is almost impossible.

The truck that I used is a 2022 Toyota Tacoma!

This setup is fluid and likely to change in the future when I discover new ideas of have different needs.

## Outside
I wanted to keep the outside of the camper as clean and minimalistic as possible. I thought this would be easy, but it was not. I needed to be able to haul skis and bikes on the outside of the truck. Here are the solutions that I came up with!
### Ski
I wanted to be able to hold 2 sets of skis.
1. They don't fit straight in the back of the truck(super lame)
2. If they are stored in the camper while I'm in the camper, snow melt gets everywhere and I end up walking all over them.

### Bike
I wanted to be able to hold 2 bikes.

## Truck Backseat
I wanted to have the ability for 4 people to ride in the cab in both travel and daily driver modes. So a backseat delete was not an option. I decided that some rearranging would be okay while in travel mode in order to accommodate more people because this would not be something that is super common while I am on the road with the camper and more of an emergency thing.
## Battery/Heater/Fridge/Microwave/Starlink
## Trash
## Bedroom
## Bathroom
The Tune doesn't have a bathroom. There are 2 situations that I commonly found myself in:
1. I am 'Stealth Camping' and need to run into a building to use the bathroom/shower, but will probably brush my teeth in the camper.
2. I am in the middle of nowhere and the bathroom is right outside.

The hanging toiletry bag was awesome for this. It hooks right on the rear lever of the camper and can stay on in both the up and down position. It is also easily detachable if I need to go in and take a shower. It is basically a super portable medicine cabinet that I also use when I travel out of a backpack!
