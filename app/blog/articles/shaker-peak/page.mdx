The route to shaker is short and straight forward:

When I got to the massive pile of rocks on the peak, I was levitating among the clouds. I couldn't see shit. I took a few steps beyond the cairn before I heard my watch start beeping. I was off course! I had the customary first thought, "Why is my watch fucked up?". I couldn't be going the wrong way. As always, after getting my bearings, I was in fact going the wrong way! At the cairn you must take a hard right. I started a blind descent into the abyss. It looked like I was walking towards a cliff!

The clouds occasionally would open up enough for me to get some sort of bearing. I was quickly assured that this was the correct route when I saw the ridge, Shaker, and Pepper. Also, no cliff! Eklutna lake even made an appearance from time to time!

        I usually do some type of research before going into the mountains, but sometimes it's nice to throw a gpx in the watch and go. If you haven't tried Garmin watch navigation for mountaineering I would highly recommend it! A little red triangle will appear near the bezel telling you where you are in relation to the track. If you get too far away, it buzzes. So simple, so nice!

In the image to the right I need to start to veer to the right! I don't know if putting all your eggs in the watch navigation basket is a good idea. I find that I am more lazy and tunnel visioned when I am using the watch. I'm constantly reminding myself to pay attention, but it's nice to be in the zone!

Before I knew it, I was standing on top of Shaker. It was only a mile away. Time to give some vertical back to the mountains and head up Salt!
