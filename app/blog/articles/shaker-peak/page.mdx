The order of the names is annoying to me. I believe that Salt, Pepper, Shaker rolls of the tongue in a way Pepper, Shaker, Salt does not. However, looking at the mountains, I like that shaker is more rounded, less prominent, and all around much more shaker shaped. Looking at the mountains, I can see why and fully agree why each peak received its name. I was wreseling with this the entire afternoon and am only starting to feel comfortable with the situation as a whole. Anyway here is an overview of the route up to Pepper:

<CenteredImage image={route} altText={"O'Malley Peak 3D Map"} width={1000} height={500} />

Lots of people stop here! I can see why, it is beautiful on a clear day you can see Eklutna Lake and deep into the Chugatch. Maybe even a glacier? It would be impossible to know!

        The route is easy and non-technical. Glen Alps trailhead is the normal place to park to climb O'Malley. It is also the normal place to park to climb Flattop, Blueberry Knoll, and the overlook at the back of the parking lot. It is the favorite of tourists visiting Anchorage. You will see tons of goofy things going on up here. Also, scary stuff. Like bro are you sure you should be trying to hike out here? Rescues are frequent. Be careful, the people are treacherous!

Head out the back of the parking lot and turn right on the Power Line Pass. You will quickly see an offshoot to the left labeled "O'Malley Peak Trail". That is what you are looking for! The trail leads up to Little O'Malley and is straightforward!

On the way up I saw this porcupine on the trail. I have mistaken these for bear cubs many times. I love how they slowly lumber down the trail. Their gait gives off a pissed off vibe. I imagine them cussing the humans as they waddle though the world. I love them! I also love dogs and I was able to save a few of the off-leash variety from getting stuck with a quill! The owners seemed upset for some reason. Next time I will let them do their thing!

After I parted ways with the porcupine I was standing on Little O'Malley ridge before I knew it! I walked down the back of the ridge onto the large meadow. Huge meadow actually. I love looking at it from Anchorage because it is so freaking big.

I won't stop talking about the meadow! It is so nice and in late June it was filled with beautiful wild flowers and so few people. Most of the tourists stop at the ridge! The hike to the back was blissful! You want to aim for the large headwall on your hike. I love an easy target and it is easy to hit the bull's-eye here!

<CenteredImage image={headwall} altText={"O'Malley Headwall"} title={"Bull's Eye!!"} width={1000} height={500} />

Climb the headwall, turn left and you are at the top! It is that easy. This is my favorite place to take out-of-towners for a few reasons:

<ul>
    <li>The start is very friendly, but usually there is a sudden realization that you are alone at some point.</li>
    <li>Turning around is easy.</li>
    <li>The scree surfing on the headwall is short yet sublime.</li>
</ul>
