I decided not to buy the ladder from Tune. This ended up being a bad decision. There isn't much information out there on the dementions for what ladder is needed and I hope this helps!

# Ladder Options

### Tune Ladder Kit
The ladder kit from Tune is probably the way to go. You can purchase the kit directly from Tune. [Ladder Kit][1]


### Tune Hooks With Third Party Ladder
You can buy the hooks from Tune without the ladder here ->  [Tune Hooks][2]

3rd party ladder options

* [TeleStep][4] (Recommended)
* [Coso 12.5][5]
* [Tune Ladder][3]  You can actually just buy the ladder from Tune as well! This is the ladder only not the kit with the hooks!

I ended up with the Coso 12.5 foot ladder, but then ended up getting the TeleStep 10.5 foot ladder. The TeleStep ladder is a far better choice

# Truck Measurements
All measurements were taken using a 2022 Toyota Tacoma. I would assume there would be similar to a full sized truck but not exact.

<TwoColumn>
<div>
### Camper Closed
It is 7 feet from the ground to the hooks when the camper is closed
<CenteredImage image={camperClosed} altText={'Tune M1 Closed'} width={'500'} height={'500'} />
</div>

<div>
### Camper Open
It is 9' 6" feet from the ground to the hooks when the camper is open
<CenteredImage image={camperOpen} altText={'Tune M1 Open'} width={'500'} height={'500'} />
</div>

</TwoColumn>

# Final Thoughts
I should have just bought the ladder from Tune. The searching just isn't worth it. I ended up bringing the 10.5 foot Telestep home and it was exactly what I needed.
