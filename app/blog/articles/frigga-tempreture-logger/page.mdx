## Review
The temperature logger works great! The only gripe I have is that the instructions are not clear on how it works! Her are the basic questions that I had before buying.

If you would like to purchase this logger, here is a link -> <FriggaLogger/>

Here are the instructions that come with the logger -> 

Here are the specs [Website][2] / Download

Q: Can you use this multiple times?
A: Yes, the description on amazon and the instructions are not super clear on this. You can reset the logger after use! Please see below! 

Q: Can you change the batteries?
A: Yes, the loggers fun on CR2450 coin batteries and they can be replaced!

## Data Export
YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD THEIR SOFTWARE!! Just plug the logger into you computer! The logger will display PDF on the screen while it is generating the report. If you navigate to the logger using your file explorer you will find the generated files!

## Battery Change
The battery looks permanently installed, it's not! Just slide something in along side the battery, I used a pocket knife, and pry it out! Here is the process!
{/* <CenteredImage image={batteryChange} altText={'Cedar Niles 3 Corners'} title={'3 Corners'} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} /> */}
