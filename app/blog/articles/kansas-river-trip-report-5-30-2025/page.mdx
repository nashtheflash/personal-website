<TLDR
text="It was great to get out on the Kansas River with a couple of old friends from high school. We set out after work on Friday and were done with the trip Saturday afternoon. We have had a wet start to the summer. Plenty of flowing water made the trip easy and fun!"
/>

We put in on the Wakarusa River launch in Eudora. The Kaw is about .8 miles down river. It was a beautiful 70 degree day. We were defiantly stealing a couple of cool days from the summer for this quick trip.

Looking at the map, I deemed this a launch only location for people paddling. Who could possible paddle against the mighty flow of the Wak? This theory was quickly disproved, buy a guy pulling up to the launch in an old aluminum canoe. I was quickly reminded how limiting a inexperienced brain can be. Somehow I always forget. As I was speaking to the guy, he had came from Lawrence, the first catastrophe of the trip emerged.

The trip consisted of a packraft(my boat), a normal hard sided kayak, and an inflatable kayak. As my buddy filled the port side of his boat with air, it sounded like a snake was under his boat. Luckly, this was not the case. Un-luckly, his boat was leaking air and even wore was the locaton. It was right next to a seam. A patch wouldn't be able to fit squarly on the hole. We did the best we could to seal the hole and it seemed to hold file. All boats leak anywhay right?

The next thing I knew I was pointed down the Wak with a yellow Coors can between my legs. Both of my friends were close behind. The Wak was a little slow and might be a little shallow later in the summer when it is more dry.

We made the confluence of the Kansas River in no time. It was like emerging a building onto a vast plane of grass. There were not longer trees covering the sky. The water not longer looked like mud but like chrome glistening in the late day sun. Cranes were on the bank. It was really beautiful. We paddled for another half hour or so before we needed to start looking for a place to camp. It is common to setup on the sandbars the form in the river. Technically this is the only legal location. Finding one was quick work.

It didn't take long to get camp setup. I love one night trips. The less gear that you have to bring just makes things so easy. We quickly set upon the next task of collecting wood for a fire. The wood was wet from the recent rain but we had a bunch of fire starters. It was a great night hanging out with some old friends.

The second disaster struck first thing the next morning. I woke up and slid out of my tent attempting to keep as much sand out of it as possible. I stood up and took survey of the camp. My two friends had already been out and a bout messing with their gear. As soon as I stood up I noticed I needed to hit the bushes. This is unusual for me first thing in the morning. Needless to say, that was just the start of feeling like shit the entire day. I was fortunately able to push through.

We made great time to the take out point. We barely even paddled. I think they thought I was being dramatic about how much paddling I did the last time on the river but I wasn't. Last time there was only 1200CFS of flow and a headwind. It makes a huge difference.
