<TLDR
text="O'Malley is an easy non-technical climb in the front range. It is very fun, the scree surfing is pleasant, and the views are spectacular. More and more tourists are finding their way over to Little O'Malley which is a great alternative if you aren't feeling up to the whole climb!"
/>

I made it up O'Malley peak on a dreary day in late June. I was lucky; when I left the truck it was starting to sprinkle and it looked like a rainy day was in my future. Fortunately, the mountains kept the rain further back in the range. I would say that it was very pleasant on the summit. It is funny how often this happens to me in the great Chugach. The map below illustrates the route nicely!

    <p className="m-0">There is a big push to divert some of the traffic from Flattop to O'Malley or maybe Little O'Malley. It is hard to tell what the plan is but it is easy to see all of the work that has been put in. Wood planks over delicate areas, exceptional signage, and absence of loneliness abound!</p>

        The route is easy and non-technical. Glen Alps trailhead is the normal place to park to climb O'Malley. It is also the normal place to park to climb Flattop, Blueberry Knoll, and the overlook at the back of the parking lot. It is the favorite of tourists visiting Anchorage. You will see tons of goofy things going on up here. Also, scary stuff. Like bro are you sure you should be trying to hike out here? Rescues are frequent. Be careful, the people are treacherous!

Head out the back of the parking lot and turn right on the Power Line Pass. You will quickly see an offshoot to the left labeled "O'Malley Peak Trail". That is what you are looking for! The trail leads up to Little O'Malley and is straightforward!

On the way up I saw this porcupine on the trail. I have mistaken these for bear cubs many times. I love how they slowly lumber down the trail. Their gait gives off a pissed off vibe. I imagine them cussing the humans as they waddle though the world. I love them! I also love dogs and I was able to save a few of the off-leash variety from getting stuck with a quill! The owners seemed upset for some reason. Next time I will let them do their thing!

After I parted ways with the porcupine I was standing on Little O'Malley ridge before I knew it! I walked down the back of the ridge onto the large meadow. Huge meadow actually. I love looking at it from Anchorage because it is so freaking big.

I won't stop talking about the meadow! It is so nice and in late June it was filled with beautiful wild flowers and so few people. Most of the tourists stop at the ridge! The hike to the back was blissful! You want to aim for the large headwall on your hike. I love an easy target and it is easy to hit the bull's-eye here!

Climb the headwall, turn left and you are at the top! It is that easy. This is my favorite place to take out-of-towners for a few reasons:

<ul>
    <li>The start is very friendly, but usually there is a sudden realization that you are alone at some point.</li>
    <li>Turning around is easy.</li>
    <li>The scree surfing on the headwall is short yet sublime.</li>
</ul>
