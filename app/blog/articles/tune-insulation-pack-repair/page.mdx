<TLDR
text="Unfortunately, my insulation pack ripped. Fortunately, it was easy cheap, fast, and easy to repair. I think this was a one off stitching issue. However, I am extremely careful when installing or removing the kit now." 
/>

I picked up the Tune in Denver and it was to the mountains to ski. Aspen had always been a little rich for my blood, but now that lodging was solved, I was heading that way. I stayed in the parking lot for the weekend but when it was time to go I noticed that the insulation kit had caused a gap(this eventually goes away). I thought it best to remove the insulation before the drive back to Kansas City. I started taking off the kit, but when I started removing the front section disaster struck!

You are going to say I was in a rush to get on the road and wasn't being careful, I swear on everything that I wasn't being rough with the insulation and I had removed all 3 other sections without issue. At the time of writing, I have removed the insulation kit about a dozen times without issue. I believe this section had some bad stitching that caused the issue, but I am no seamstress.

## Tune Support
It's worth saying that Tune support is second to none in the camper industry. These guys take care of you and this situation was no different! They said they had never seen this issue, further leading me to believe that this was caused by defective stitching.

## The Fix
Tune took care of the situation, but I was left with an insulation panel that had only been used 4 days. I wanted to try to fix the panel without driving to my grandma's house in Sioux Falls for a sewing lesson. My general opinion is that Tenacious Tape can fix anything short of a broken heart. So lets tape it! I am no expert on this topic, but I believe the tear is in the worst position possible. 

Supplies:
1. Tenacious Tape
2. Rubbing Alcohol
<CenteredImage image={supplies} altText={'Tune Repair Supplies'} title={'Supplies Needed'} width={500} height={500} />

The Process: 

1. I stuffed the insulation back in using a credit card.
2. Cleaned the area with alcohol based on the directions supplied with the tap
3. Applied tap
4. Weighted the area overnight
5. Repeat on the other side!

Here is the end result:

This has been working for the last 4 months. Will it work for the next 10 years? Only time will tell!
