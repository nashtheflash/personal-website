<TLDR
text="Unfortunately, my insulation pack ripped. Fortunately it was easy cheap, fast, and easy to repair. I think this was a one off stitching issue. However, I am extremely careful when installing or removing the kit now." 
/>

I picked up the Tune in Denver and it was too the mountains to ski. Aspen had always been a little rich for my blood, but now that lodging was solved, I was heading that way. I Stayed in the parking lot for the weekend but when it was time to go I noticed that the insulation kit had caused a gap(this eventually goes away). I though it best to remove the insulation before the drive back to Kansas City. I started taking off the kit, but when got to the front sections disaster struck!

You are going to say I was in a rush to get on the road and wasn't being careful, I swear on everything that I was. I wasn't doing and big rips and I had removed all 3 other sections without issue. At the time of writing, I have removed the insulation kit about a dozen times without issue. I believe this section had some bat stitching that caused the issue, but I am no seamstress.

## Tune Support
It's worth saying that Tune support is second to non in the camper industry. These guys take care of you and this situation was no different! They said they had never seen this issue, further leading me to believe that this was caused by defective stitching.

## The Fix
Tune took care of the situation, but I was left with a insulation panel that had only been used 4 days. I wanted to try to fix the panel without driving to my grandmas house in Sioux Falls for a sewing lesson. My general opinion is that Tenacious Tap can fix anything short of a broken heart. So lets tape it? I am no expert on this topic, but I believe the tear is in the worst position possible. 

Supplies:
1. Tenacious Tap
2. Rubbing Alcohol

The Process: 

1. I stuffed the insulation back in using a credit card.
2. Cleaned the area with alchohal based on the directions supplied with the tap
3. Applied tap
4. Weighted the area overnight
5. Repeat on the other side!

Here is the end result:

This has been working for the last 4 months. Will it work for the next 10 year? Only time will tell!
