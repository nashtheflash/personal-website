# Tune Issues
This is a list of all the issues I have encountered while owning the tune camper. There are going to be issues with any camper, so this is not a knock on Tune.


## Loose Heater Fittings
<TwoColumn>
    When I first bought the camper the heater would not start. I tried to fire it probably 50 times and no dice. I found the issue to be a flange fitting that was only hand tight. I tight it and everything worked great!

## Bad Light Cord
<TwoColumn>
    <CenteredImage image={badCord} altText={'Tune M1 Bad Light Cord'} title={'Bad COrd'} width={'500'} height={'500'} />
    I drove from Kansas City to Aspen to ski. When I opend the top the lights would not come no. Huge bummer. I found that the issue was caused by a bad USB-C to 12V barrel connector.

    I also found that the included starlink cable works in a pinch, and was extreamly helpful in trouble shooting the issue. The starlink cable is so long, and there are so many berrel conectors in the lighing wireing, I was able to plug dirrectly into the system in diffrent places to narrow down the issue!

## Insulation Kit Rip

While uninstalling the Tune Insulation Kit, it just tore. I am not sure how this could have been prevented. I was being supper gentle. I would defiantly only pull from the Velcro and as close to the sticking point as possible!
