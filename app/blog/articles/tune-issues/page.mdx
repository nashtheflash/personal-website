## Loose Heater Fittings
<TwoColumn>
    <div>
    When I first bought the camper, the heater would not start. I tried to fire it probably 50 times and no dice. I found the issue to be a flange fitting that was only hand tight. I tightened it, and voil√†! Everything worked great!
    <br/>
    I have used the heater for an entire winter now. The issue definitely damaged my trust in the system, but I haven't had a single other issue with the heater and I love it!

## Bad Light Cord

    </div>
    <div className={'w-full sm:w-1/2'}>
    I drove from Kansas City to Aspen to ski. When I opened the top the lights would not come on. Huge bummer. I found that the issue was caused by a bad USB-C to 12V barrel connector.

    </div>
    <div className={'w-full sm:w-1/2'}>
    I also found that the included Starlink cable works in a pinch, and was extremely helpful in troubleshooting the issue. The Starlink cable is so long, and there are so many barrel connectors in the wire, I was able to plug directly into the system in different places to narrow down the issue!
<br/>
If the lights go out I would make sure that all of the barrel connectors are plugged in. I haven't had additional issues, but with the sheer number of connections in the system, one is bound to come unplugged at some point!

## Insulation Kit Rip

While uninstalling the Tune Insulation Kit, it just tore. I am not sure how this could have been prevented. I was being super gentle. I would definitely only pull from the Velcro and as close to the sticking point as possible!

Luckily, Tune sent a replacement, and I was also able to repair the tear! You can read about the repair here: [Tune Insulation Pack Repair][1]
