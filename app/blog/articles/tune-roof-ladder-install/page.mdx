I decided not to buy the ladder from Tune. This ended up being a bad decision. There isn't much information out there on the dementions for what ladder is needed and I hope this helps!

# Ladder Options

### Tune Ladder Kit
The ladder kit from Tune is probably the way to go. You can purchase the kit directly from Tune. [Ladder Kit][1]


### Tune Hooks With Third Party Ladder
You can buy the hooks from Tune without the ladder here ->  [Tune Hooks][2]

3rd party ladder options

* Options 1 
* Options 2 
* Options 3
* You can actually just buy the ladder from Tune as well -> [Tune Ladder][3]

I ended U up with the Coso 12.5 foot ladder.

# Truck Measurements
All measurments were taken using a 2022 Toyota Tacoma. I would assume there would be similar to a full sized truck but not exact.

### Camper Closed
It is 7 feet from the ground to the hooks when the camper is closed

<div>
### Camper Open
It is 9' 6" feet from the ground to the hooks when the camper is open

<TwoCenteredImages image={[featureImage, featureImage]} altText={['West Trailhead', 'Trail Entrance']} titles={['West Trailhead', 'Trail Entrance']} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

# Final Thoughts
I should have just bought the ladder from Tune. The searching just isn't worth it.
