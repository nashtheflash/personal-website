# Hostels in la fortuna

We stayed at alpha arenal hostel where we were in town and you can see the full review of that place here -> . In general the hostel situation is pretty nice in town and I would recommend staying at one if you get a good price.

# Hostel Row
I called this street hosel row but im not sure how true that is. Really there were 2 large hostels that seemed more traditional and less like a hotel. There was one other more traditional hostel on the main drag that might be worth checking out! Other than that, you might be shelling out some cash.

Hostel row sits on a dead end road or coldesac type thing. Its nice because there is less traffic moving through the area. We left our car on the road and I felt good about it.

add picture of hostl row here.

We waled up and down this road to town frequently in varise states of intoxication and at all hours of the day and night. I never felt out o place or unconfortable. The to hosels are La Fortuna Lodge on the left and Alpha Arenal on the right. La Fortuna seemed like it had an older crowd, older than 25, and Alpha Arenal was younger. I am 27 and definatly felt a little old while staying at the Alpha. I like to do some working while traveling and both places had areas to do that. Basically if you have extra cash to spend, I would stay at Lafortuna. WHen you get there you'll be like, 'dang this place it pretty sick'.


Here are some more shots of the Tuna, keep in mind we did not stay there!



As with all of my reviews keep in mind I'm just a dude from Alaska.
Have fun out there.
