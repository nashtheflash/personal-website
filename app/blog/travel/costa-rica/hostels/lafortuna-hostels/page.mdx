# Hostels in La Fortuna

We stayed at Alpha Arenal hostel where we were in town and you can see the full review of that place here -> [Alpha Arenal](/blog/travel/costa-rica/hostels/alpha-arenal "Alpha Arenal") . In general the hostel situation is pretty nice in town and I would recommend staying at one if you get a good price.

# Hostel Row
I called this street hostel row but I'm not sure how true that is. Really there were 3 large hostels that seemed more traditional and less like a hotel. There was one other more traditional hostel on the main drag that might be worth checking out! Other than that, you might be shelling out some cash.

Hostel row sits on a dead end road or cul-de-sac type thing that has the volcano as a backdrop. Its nice because there is less traffic moving through the area. We left our car on the road and I felt good about it.

We walked up and down this road to town frequently in various states of intoxication and at all hours of the day and night. I never felt out of place or uncomfortable. The to hostels are La Fortuna Lodge on the left and Alpha Arenal on the right and Hotel Arenal Xilopalo at the end of the road. La Fortuna Lodge and Xilopalo seemed like it had an older crowd, older than 25, and Alpha Arenal was younger. I am 27 and defiantly felt a little old while staying at the Alpha. I like to do some working while traveling and both places had areas to do that. Basically if you have extra cash to spend, I would stay at La Fortuna Lodge. When you get there you'll be like, 'dang this place it pretty sick'.


Here are some shots of the Tuna and Alpha Arenal, keep in mind we only stayed at Alpha Arenal!

Another option is the Selena in town. We stayed at a few of these on the cost later in our trip and they were nice but more expensive. Defiantly worth taking a look at!



As with all of my reviews keep in mind I'm just a dude from Alaska.
Have fun out there.
