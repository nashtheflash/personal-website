# Alpha Arenal Review

<CenteredImage image={featureImage} altText={'Hotel Picture'} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

This place was good for the money, but keep in mind, you get what you pay for! I would stay here again.

## Location
Location was great, about a min walk to downtown. I wouldn't hesitate to walk it at 2 in the morning, but as always take normal precautions.

## Common Areas
The common areas were some what nice and clean, there were hammocks, outdoor couches, and an upper level deck that was a nice place to drink a beer at night.

Here is one of the towns dogs taking full advantage of one of the couches. Everywhere we went we saw dogs and it was common that that would wonder by and through the hostels. We are dog loves and approached every single one without issue but it is probably good to remain cautious.

## Rooms
The room we had was everything that me needed. It ad a shower and toilet. I would say that it was pretty clean. The bed was really clean, bathroom was okay. I did see some animal(presumable mouse) droppings on a ledge, but it was nothing that would stop me from renting.

## Sleeping
It was warm, there wasn't any A/C, but there was a fan that made it cool enough for me to sleep well and also drowned out some of the noises from the neighbors and roof. When I say roof, I mean from animals crawling on it. The roof was just corrugated metal with no insulation. A few times during the night it sounded like a lizard was up there crawling around. Other times it was birds. Either animal cause a very loud sound, either scurrying or hopping around. I though it was funny and enjoyed the closeness to the outside. Some might find it hard to sleep. My guess is that you would not be able to hear any of this if you were on the ground floor. Another thing that I heard during the night was what sounded like mice. It sounded like there were crawling through the wall. This account may make it sound like this place was overrun with animals, but it didn't feel that way. The people at the hostel made normals amount of noise throughout the night, not crazy parties or drunks. See the neighbors section for nighttime noise level.

## Neighbors
Night one was a Saturday and there was a party next door. Just load music, in no way did it spill onto the street of was even noticeable other than the loud music. I can sleep anywhere so I honestly could care less. The second night I woke up to some loud cars a couple of times. Not much that can be don't about that and I would suspect that everywhere you would stay in La Fortuna would also have these noises.

## Parking
We had read online to avoid parking on the street at all cost(this is almost imposable to follow anywhere). I parked on the street here without hesitation. It is nice that this is on a dead in road which leads to less traffic. Here was the parting situation:

## Summary
I would stay here if the price was right. Before booking, I would check out the La Fortuna Lodge and Selina. I'm sure that both are more expensive, but for an extra $10-20 a night its probably worth it. At the time of writing you can contact the hotel at
