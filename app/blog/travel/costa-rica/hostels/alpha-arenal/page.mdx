# Alpha Arenal

<CenteredImage image={featureImage} altText={'Hotel Picture'} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

This place was good for the money, but keep in mind, you get what you pay for! I would stay here again.

## Common Areas
The common areas were some what nice and clean, there were hammocks, outdoor couches, and an upper level deck that was a nice place to drink a beer at night.

Here is one of the towns dogs taking full advantage of one of the couches. Everywhere we went we say dogs and it was common that that would wonder by and through the hostels. We are dog loves and approached every single one without issue but it is probably good to remain cautious.

## Rooms
The room we had was everything that me needed. It ad a shower and toilet. I would say that it was pretty clean. The bed was really clean, bathroom was okay. I did see some animal(presumable mouse) droppins on a ledge, but it was nothing that would stop me from renting.

## Sleeping
It was warm, there wasn't any A/C, but there was a fan that was enough for me to sleep well and also drowned out some of the noises from the neighbors and roof. When I say roof, I mean from animals crawling on it. The roof was just corigated metal with no insulation. It sounded like a lizard would get up there sometime and crawl around a make a very loud scuring sound. I though it was funny and enjoyed the closeness to the outside. Some might find it hard to sleep. I also heard the sound of mice in the wall. It should like this place was overrun with animals, but I wouldn't say that and was not bothered at all. The people at the hosel made normals amount of noise throught the night, not crazy parties or drunks. See the neighbors section for nightime noise level.

## Neighbors
Night 1 was a Saturday and there was a party next door. Just load music, in no way did it spill onto the street of was even noticable other than the loud music. I can seel anywhere so I honestly could care less. THe second night I woke up to some loud cars a couple of times. Not much that can be dont about that and I would suspect that everywhere you would stay in la fortuna would also have these noises.

## Location
Location was great, about a min walk to downtown. I wouldn't hesitat to walk it at 2 in the morning, but as always take normal percautions.
