# The difinitive guide to la fortuna

La fortuna is a weird mix of supper turisty stuff and locals doing wheels up and down the road on motorcycles. I liked it!

# THe Summary
I would try to stay away from the turisty stuff. It is overpriced. If you want 5 star dinning go to LA or something. There were a few sodas in town offering some good foor. We went to the 'brewery' on the main street and paid $5 for a can or imperial so I would go ahead and skip that haha. A taco place on by the park was good and pretty afordable. Use general comon sence while making a selection! Check out my guid on selecting restrants here -> .

# The park
The park was a cool palce to hand out. I enjoied drinking a couple of beers on the deck of the hostil then crusing over and people watching with my girlfriend. It was very buisy every night that we were there.

#Finding Drugs
I dont do drugs, so take everything with a grain of salt, walking down the main drag i was offered a little bit of everything.
