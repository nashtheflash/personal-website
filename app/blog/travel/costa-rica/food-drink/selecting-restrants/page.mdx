# How I Select Restrants in COstr Rica

# Decide what you are looking for

## If you looking for a toristy place
Go whereever honestly. You know what you like!

## If you looking for an afordable place
Look inside, if you see a bunch or Amaaricans, Europeans, Asian you should probably do some where else. If you are the only non south amarican in the restrant then you are probably in the right place! I like the cheap but high quality authentic stuff. Sometimes you kiss some toads in the search for the goods, but if you try a few times you'll get better at making selections. I eat almost exclusivly at Sodas. Buy booze at the grocery store if thats your thing!
