# How to Modify an ActionPacker for Flight
Flying with totes is pretty common in Alaska. This is how I modify my ActionPackers for flight!

## My Action Packer
Here is my 24gal ActionPacker! If you are reading this then I am sure that you are already familiar. If not, here is some additional reading:\

## Why Can't I Just Fly with an ActionPacker?
They will open!! I have tried and it went terrible. The good news is that with a simple modification, you can get your ActionPacker flight ready!

## The First Attempt
I made 2 errors in the first build. 

1. **Don't use a pull strap**\
When the box came around the carousel, the strap had loosened a fair amount. Not to the point of it being and issue, the box did not open, but it was concerning. I used the simple pull straps so that the TSA could easily open and close the box if needed.

2. **The mounting handles on the handles did not go all the way through**\
The mounting holes on the handles were closed off which made it hard to get the length of the bolts right during the build. I would be far easier if the holes went all the way through, it will also probably be stronger.

## The Final Modification
With the lessons learned from the first build, I am going to fix the box so that it will fly better!
