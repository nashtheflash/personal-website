# Local Docs
I was on a fligh with nothing to do and wanted to continue learning. I was pleasently supprised that the rust install has the docs built in! To view the local copy of the docs simply run:

```
rustup docs
```
### From the Docs
The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it
offline. Run rustup doc to open the local documentation in your browser.
