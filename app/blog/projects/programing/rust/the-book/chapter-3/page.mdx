# Chapter 3
Chapter three was a big on that covered the basics needed to make simple programs. You can and should take a look -> [Rust Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html "Rust Chapter 3")

## Variables and Mutability
Variables are basically the same as Javascript. **let** and **const** are used to instantiate variables. However, variables are immutable by default. So **let** in Javascript is actually **let mut** in Rust. In Javascript I almost exclusively use **const** but the docs say not to do this in Rust. I am assuming that it is because the values cannot be computed at runtime:\

"The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime."\

Shadowing is cool. I used it a decent amount in the projects in this section. I like that you don't have to do lots of weird renaming.

## Data Types
This sections was new to me but probably pretty basic if you are coming from a language with types.

## Functions
Functions have similar syntax to Javascript. However I hate the return syntax. This function would return nothing:
```rs
fn my_func() {
    10;
}
```
This would return 10:
```rs
fn my_func() {
    10
}
```

I just don't really like that. I think it will be hard to look for the semicolon. I would prefer **return** keyword.

## Comments
Basically the same a Javascript.

## Control Flow
Also, basically the same as Javascript.

## Projects
Most of my programming experience is with Javascript. The following projects were really my first exposure to type safety. It was eye opening. I always thought that the concept was fairly straight forward, and if I ever needed to use something like Typescript it would be easy to pick up. Type issues were really the only problems I encountered while making the below projects. I am starting to understand why some people like Typescript, but I also don't at the same time... My current thought is that if I want to crank something out quickly I would rather just use Javascript and if there is something that requires type safety I would rather use something like Rust. That idea could very easily change in the future.
