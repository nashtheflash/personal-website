# What I Learned Chapter 1

## Instillation
I was able to get up and running without issue. My OS is Linux so that makes things easier. I simply ran:

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

then as stated in the docs, I checked the version for Rust and Cargo:

```
rustc --version
// rustc 1.78.0 (9b00956e5 2024-04-29)

cargo --version
// cargo 1.78.0 (54d8815d0 2024-03-26)
```

All looked like it should so I continued to the hello world example to verify further

# Hello World
I like this project because it is hard to mess up and will further verify development environment setup. From the command line I ran:

```
cargo new hello-world
```

This will crate a new project in the hello-world directory. cd into it and try to run the project in the terminal:

```
cargo run
```

"hello world" printed and all looked good. I also did a quick check on my NeoVim config to make sure that was working. I opened up /src/main.rc and highlighting was there and the LSP was providing auto complete.

# Small Addition to the hello wold project
The book adds on to the typical hello world project by having you bring in a package and it prints the fallowing crab!

When you add the ferris-says package to the cargo.toml file you will see this in the terminal! Below is actual rust code running on Vercel and rendered using React & MDX. Pretty cool huh? While making a few changes to the project that would send the characters to the browser instead of printing them in the terminal, I found the clippy mascot in the ferris-says package so I added the option to print clippy as well.

# Summary
Just basic setup nothing groundbreaking here.
