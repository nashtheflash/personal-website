# How I Am Learning Rust

# How I Learn Languages
I was 10, I wanted to try out programing, I told my mom I needed to go get this book I had read about online at the book store. Latter that day I was at my computer with Learning Pythong the Hard Way. It changed how I approch leaning new things and it is how I will be learning Rust. I will be reading the book, typing all of the examples by hand, and adding small bits of functionality without investing to much time on any specific project. While reading keep in mind that I am not an expert developer. I am just a guy from Alaska.
