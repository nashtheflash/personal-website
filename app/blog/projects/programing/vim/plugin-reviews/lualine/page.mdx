## What Does This Plugin Do?
Basically, this plugin is just a theme for your status line, but it also goes a little further than that. You can also show all kinds of information on it. There are tons of themes. You can check them out here -> [Lualine Themes](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim/blob/master/THEMES.md  "Lualine Themes"). I am going to start by using the default theme and here is what my line looks like.

<CenteredImage image={defaultLine} altText={'Buffer Added to Status Line'} width={'w-full'} height={'h-full'}/>

Looking Closer:
<TwoCenteredImages image={[leftSide, rightSide]} altText={['Full Room Picture', 'Picture of Bathroom']} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

## Instillation
```lua
Plug 'nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons'
```

Defaut Config that I added to lualine.lua:
```lua
    require('lualine').setup {
      options = {
        icons_enabled = true,
        theme = 'auto',
        component_separators = { left = '', right = ''},
        section_separators = { left = '', right = ''},
        disabled_filetypes = {
          statusline = {},
          winbar = {},
        },
        ignore_focus = {},
        always_divide_middle = true,
        globalstatus = false,
        refresh = {
          statusline = 1000,
          tabline = 1000,
          winbar = 1000,
        }
      },
      sections = {
        lualine_a = {'mode'},
        lualine_b = {'branch', 'diff', 'diagnostics'},
        lualine_c = {'filename'},
        lualine_x = {'encoding', 'fileformat', 'filetype'},
        lualine_y = {'progress'},
        lualine_z = {'location'}
      },
      inactive_sections = {
        lualine_a = {},
        lualine_b = {},
        lualine_c = {'filename'},
        lualine_x = {'location'},
        lualine_y = {},
        lualine_z = {}
      },
      tabline = {},
      winbar = {},
      inactive_winbar = {},
      extensions = {}
    }
```

## Components
Components are an easy way to add functionality to Lualine. Here are the avalable components: 

```lua
branch (git branch)
buffers (shows currently available buffers)
diagnostics (diagnostics count from your preferred source)
diff (git diff status)
encoding (file encoding)
fileformat (file format)
filename
filesize
filetype
hostname
location (location in file in line:column format)
mode (vim mode)
progress (%progress in file)
searchcount (number of search matches when hlsearch is active)
selectioncount (number of selected characters or lines)
tabs (shows currently available tabs)
windows (shows currently available windows)
```
lets add a components, I need to be able to see the open buffers, so lets add the buffers component. We will need to go to the plugin config file and make some changes in the sections object. Lualine supports 3 components on the left side of the screen and 3 components on the right side of the screen. We are going to replace the lualine_c pramiter in the sections object with the buffers component.

<FromToCode
    from={`
      sections = {
          lualine_a = {'mode'},
          lualine_b = {'branch', 'diff', 'diagnostics'},
        - lualine_c = {'filename'},
          lualine_x = {'encoding', 'fileformat', 'filetype'},
          lualine_y = {'progress'},
          lualine_z = {'location'}
      },
    `}
    to={`
      sections = {
          lualine_a = {'mode'},
          lualine_b = {'branch', 'diff', 'diagnostics'},
        + lualine_c = {'buffer'},
          lualine_x = {'encoding', 'fileformat', 'filetype'},
          lualine_y = {'progress'},
          lualine_z = {'location'}
      }
    `}
/>

<CenteredImage image={bufferAdd} altText={'Lua Line'} width={'w-fit'} height={'h-full'}/>

Components are easy to add and from the above example it should be easy to configure the line as needed, but what if you need more? What if you want a custom component?

## Lets Add Functionality (Custom Component)
I want to implement a simple word counter that I can use while writing blog posts. I want it to display how many words are on the page, and also weather I am over, under, or in a predesignated range. For instance, I want to know how may words are in my blog post(so only mdx files), and I want my blog posts to be between 500 and 750 words. Seems simple enough, lets try it out.

## Can I edit my vimrc / init.lua Instead of Using This Plugin?
Maybe, I played around with this a little and it is easy to append // to the from of a line, but do you want to figure that out for every language? I would recommend getting this plugin instead of reinventing the wheel!

Link to the project -> [Lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim  "Lualine.nvim")

Regardless of what I think about the plugin, I want to say thank you to everyone that is contributing to Neovim! Nothing is meant to be negative, my opinions are just that, opinions!
