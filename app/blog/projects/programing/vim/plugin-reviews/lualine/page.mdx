## What Does This Plugin Do?
Basically, this plugin is just a theme for your status line, but it also goes a little further than that. You can also show all kinds of information on it. There are tons of themes. You can check them out here -> [Lualine Themes](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim/blob/master/THEMES.md  "Lualine Themes"). I am going to start by using the default theme and here is what my line looks like.

<CenteredImage image={defaultLine} altText={'Hotel Picture'} width={'h-full'} height={'w-full'}/>

Looking Closer:
<TwoCenteredImages image={[leftSide, rightSide]} altText={['Full Room Picture', 'Picture of Bathroom']} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

## Instillation
```lua
Plug 'nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons'
```

Defaut Config that I added to lualine.lua:
```lua
    require('lualine').setup {
      options = {
        icons_enabled = true,
        theme = 'auto',
        component_separators = { left = '', right = ''},
        section_separators = { left = '', right = ''},
        disabled_filetypes = {
          statusline = {},
          winbar = {},
        },
        ignore_focus = {},
        always_divide_middle = true,
        globalstatus = false,
        refresh = {
          statusline = 1000,
          tabline = 1000,
          winbar = 1000,
        }
      },
      sections = {
        lualine_a = {'mode'},
        lualine_b = {'branch', 'diff', 'diagnostics'},
        lualine_c = {'filename'},
        lualine_x = {'encoding', 'fileformat', 'filetype'},
        lualine_y = {'progress'},
        lualine_z = {'location'}
      },
      inactive_sections = {
        lualine_a = {},
        lualine_b = {},
        lualine_c = {'filename'},
        lualine_x = {'location'},
        lualine_y = {},
        lualine_z = {}
      },
      tabline = {},
      winbar = {},
      inactive_winbar = {},
      extensions = {}
    }
```

## Limitations and Alternatives


## Can I edit my vimrc / init.lua Instead of Using This Plugin?
Maybe, I played around with this a little and it is easy to append // to the from of a line, but do you want to figure that out for every language? I would recommend getting this plugin instead of reinventing the wheel!

Link to the project -> [Lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim  "Lualine.nvim")

Regardless of what I think about the plugin, I want to say thank you to everyone that is contributing to Neovim! Nothing is meant to be negative, my opinions are just that, opinions!
