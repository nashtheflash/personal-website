## What Does This Plugin Do?
Basically, this plugin is just a theme for your status line, but it also goes a little further than that. You can also show all kinds of information on it. There are tons of themes. You can check them out here -> [Airline Themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/wiki/Screenshots  "Airline Themes"). I am going to start by using the default theme and here is what my line looks like.

<CenteredImage image={exampleLine} altText={'Status Line example'} width={'w-2/3'} height={'h-3/4'}/>

## Instillation
For more context, You can see how I setup my Neovim Files here: [Wired's Neovim File Structure][999]

The readme offers options for many plugin managers:
| Plugin Manager | Install with... |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Pathogen][11] | `git clone https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline ~/.vim/bundle/vim-airline`<br/>Remember to run `:Helptags` to generate help tags |
| [NeoBundle][12] | `NeoBundle 'vim-airline/vim-airline'` |
| [Vundle][13] | `Plugin 'vim-airline/vim-airline'` |
| [Plug][40] | `Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'` |
| [VAM][22] | `call vam#ActivateAddons([ 'vim-airline' ])` |
| [Dein][52] | `call dein#add('vim-airline/vim-airline')` |
| [minpac][55] | `call minpac#add('vim-airline/vim-airline')` |
| pack feature (native Vim 8 package feature)| `git clone https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/vim-airline`<br/>Remember to run `:helptags ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/vim-airline/doc` to generate help tags |
| manual | copy all of the files into your `~/.vim` directory |

I use vim-plug so I'll add this to my plugins file:
```lua
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
```

No need to add additional configuration. This plugin will work of of the box and look like:
<CenteredImage image={defaultLine} altText={'Airline default'} width={'w-2/3'} height={'h-3/4'}/>

A little ugly, but lets fix that! I want it to look like the example at the top of this article, so I am going to change the theme to base16. In order to do that we need to install the theme plugin
```lua
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
```
To set the theme, and if you are using my folder structure, you will go to .vim/vimrc and add this line:
```vim
let g:airline_theme='base16'
```
Now our line looks like:
<CenteredImage image={base16Line} altText={'Airline Base16 Theme'} width={'w-2/3'} height={'h-3/4'}/>
This is good, but it doesn't really look like the example, lets change the dividers. I tried a million things to try to get this to work without installing anything without success. I followed a post a found that said I needed to install Powerline Fonts. Here is the script I an and the repo.

[Powerline Fonts][65]
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
> cd fonts
> ./install.sh
> cd ..
> rm -rf fonts
```

After that was installed, All I needed to add to my vimrc was:

```vim
let g:airline_left_sep=''
let g:airline_right_sep=''
```
Now our line looks a little better:
<CenteredImage image={dividerSetup} altText={'Airline Divider Setup'} width={'w-2/3'} height={'h-3/4'}/>

## Smarter tab line
This seems to be something that other lines do not offer. Lets add the following to our vimrc ant take a look:

```vim
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
```
A bar has appeared at the top of the screen(I made the window small for the picture):
<CenteredImage image={smartTabLine} altText={'Airline Smart Tab Line'} width={'w-2/3'} height={'h-3/4'}/>
I am sure that some people love this thing, but its not for me. I like having the buffers on the usual line on the left. I like how Lualine does it!!

## Components
Lets extend this thing. It looks like there are a decent amount of options for components. One caught my eye immediately: [tmuxline][66]

I added this to my plugin file:
```lua
Plug 'edkolev/tmuxline.vim'
```
Wallah, it works. All I had to do was add it with vim-plug. I did not read the docs well enough. I thought his was going to merge the 2 status lines similar to the way [vim-tpipeline][67] does. It loos fine but a massive 2 line status bar is not for me!
<CenteredImage image={tmuxLine} altText={'Tmuxline Example'} width={'w-2/3'} height={'h-3/4'}/>

To sum this up, I really like this option for creating a status line. I think that it is a little hard to configure, but there are alot of options. I spent the afternoon messing around and was able to get a good looking status line that integrated well with Tmux! If I was looking for a status line to use with Vim only, this would be my pick.

## Limitations and Alternatives
<StatusLineComparison/>

## Can I edit my vimrc / init.lua Instead of Using This Plugin?
Yes you can and its not that hard!\
Vim script -> [Build a Custom Vim Status Line](/blog/projects/programing/vim/build-a-vim-status-line  "Build a Custom Vim Status Line")\
Lua -> [Build a Custom Neovim Status Line](/blog/projects/programing/vim/build-a-vim-status-line  "Build a Custom Neovim Status Line")

Link to the project -> [Airline.nvim](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline  "Airline.nvim")

Regardless of what I think about the plugin, I want to say thank you to everyone that is contributing to Neovim! Nothing is meant to be negative, my opinions are just that, opinions!
