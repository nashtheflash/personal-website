# Comment.nvim Review
⚡ Smart and Powerful commenting plugin for Neovim ⚡

Unlike most of the reviews that are first looks, I have been using this plugin for some time now. I really enjoy it although I really only use gcc in normal mode and gc in visual-block mode. Part of why I like doing these reviews is that I can do a deep dive, and visit all of the features that the plugin has to offer.

## What Does This Plugin Do?
This plugin makes commenting out lines or blocks of code easy. This is similar to what CTRL+/ in vsCode does. If you are on a line and it CTRL+/ it will comment out the line, if you have a block of text highlighted, it will comment out the entire block. Comment.nvim attempts to add this functionality to Neovim.

## Limitations
From the docs: No jsx/tsx support. Its implementation was quite complicated. Bummer! Like I said, I have been using this plugin for a few months and noticed that jsx was not highlighting correctly. I thought this was a config issue but apparently not.

## Can I edit my vimrc / init.lua Instead of Using This Plugin?
Maybe, I played around with this a little and it is easy to append // to the from of a line, but do you want to figure that out for every language? I would recommend getting this plugin instead of reinventing the wheel!

Regardless of what I think about the plugin, I want to say thank you to everyone that is contributing to Neovim! Nothing is meant to be negative, my opinions are just that, opinions!
