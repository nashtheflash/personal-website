| 1x 8 Ounce Bag| Old Dutch Puffed Corn Curls|
| 1 Cup         | Butter                     |

| 1/2 Cup       | Light Corn Syrup           |
| 1 Teaspoon    | Baking Soda                |

### Method
Place corn curls in a jelly roll or other suitable pan for oven. On stove top in 2 quart saucepan, cook for 2 minutes the butter, brown sugar and corn syrup. Add baking soda; mixture will foam quite a bit. Pour carmel mixture over popcorn and stir until mixed. Place in a 250 degree oven for 45 minutes, stirring every 10 or 15 minutes. Remove from oven and pour onto waxed paper; break apart.

### Additional Information
I remember Mom making this yummy snack; air popped popcorn works as well, but the puffs are nice because they have no seeds or hulls!
