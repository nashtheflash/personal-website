### Method
Mix all ingredients well. It may seem runny and gloppy with oatmeal, which is ok-batter should be thin. Pour about a half cup into a hot skillet sprayed with nonstick oil and turn pan in a large circle to fully cover the bottom with the batter. When it appears dry, flip and cook the other side another few minutes. Then serve hot; top a strip down the middle with powdered sugar and jam, or butter and cinnamon sugar, or fruit and ice cream. Wrap up with knife and fork, cut in slice to eat.

### Additional Information
When I lived in Denmark for a semester in college, my host mother Kristen made these often. The family would enjoy them at all hours of the day, even as a late night snack! The recipe started from her saying "a bit of this...enough of that...til it looks right!". So when I make it a lot is open to improvisation. Kirsten was a very special woman, great cook, loving host mother.
