### Method
Heat Over to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowel, combine the pumpkin, sugar, water vegetable oil, and eggs. Beat until well mixed.

Measure the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and ground cloves into a separate bowl, then stir until combined. Slowly add dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture, beating until smooth.

Grease to 9 x 5 inch loaf pans and dust them with flour. Evenly divide batter between them. Bake for 60 or 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool for about 10-15 minutes. Remove from pans by inverting them onto a rack and tapping the bottoms. Slice and serve with butter.
