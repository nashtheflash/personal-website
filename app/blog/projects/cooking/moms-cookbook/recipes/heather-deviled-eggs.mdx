| 1 Dozen       | Eggs                       |
| 1 Pinch       | Salt                       |

### Method
Let eggs sit in warm water awhile before boiling to acoid cracking. Bring water to boil; boil eggs 18-20 minutes, turning eggs gently and frequently. Then set eggs in cool water to help set the yolks and ease removal. Peel eggs and sut in half, then slip out the yolks. Mash all yolks with a potato masher or fork. Stir in (or use blender, but do not over mix or it will become to runny) salt, mustard, miracle whip and sugar to taste. Fill eggs (may use frosting tip device for added aesthetic enjoyment) and then sprinkle with paprika.
