Mix first three ingredients well; roll a ball and divide in two. Pat dough with hands into two strips and place on ungreased (or lined with parchment paper) cookie sheet. Take 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup water; bring to boil. Add almond and remove from heat. Stir in flour immediately and constantly. When smooth and thick, add eggs one at a time; beat well. Divide mixture between the two strips of dough. Bake 55 to 60 minutes at 350. It will be puffy. Remove from oven. Cool. Spread with frosting: 1/4 cup butter, powdered sugar and vanilla. Sprinkle with nuts if desired. Best serve when fresh( same day).
