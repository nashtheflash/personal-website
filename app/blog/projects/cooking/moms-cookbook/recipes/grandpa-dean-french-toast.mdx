## Grandpa Deans's French Toast
### Ingredients

| Amount Measure | Ingredient                |
| :------------: | :-----------------------: |
| 1 Large        | Egg per 2 pieces of toast |
| 1 Tablespoon | Milk for every egg          |
| 1 Tablespoon | Sugar per egg               |

### Method
Beat ingredients with a fork. Melt 1 T butter on medium heat--not to hot, just melted. Old dried-out bread is best.

### Additional Information
Dean has made this on Sunday mornings at the farm since I have been in the family. Once upon a time, a secret(garlic powder!) ingredient was revealed and the ensuing reaction has made the secret continue... to garlic or not to garlic, that is the question.
