# ZoomInfo Decision
We chose to move forward with ZoomInfo, and at the time of writing, are very excited.

## Who **Should Not** Use ZoomInfo
I covered this in my other post outlining the demo process, you can read that here -> [ZoomInfo Demo][1]. Here are industies that I think would be hard to use the data that ZoomInfo provides:
1. E-commerce
2. Brick and Mortar Retail
3. Small Price tag / Low Margin Products
4. B2C Business in general
This is just the opinion of someone that is not apart of any of the above industries. I am sure there sales department would have something to say about that list, and if I were you I would give them a chance to plead there case. They offer an impressive product. Another thing to keep in mind is that you have to have a sales department with enough bandwidth to utilize this new source of expensive leads.

## Who **Should** Use ZoomInfo
Companies that offer an expensive product that is not "shopped" for would be a good fit for ZoomInfo. If I was selling directly to consumers, I don't think the data would be valuable unless it helped to run more targeted adds. My company does business nation wide, and I think that makes the product even more appealing. Here are a few industries that I think would benefit from this product:
1. Cooperate Car Sales
2. Cooperate Sales Training
3. Cooperate Machine and Industrial Automation
4. Cooperate Software Sales
Notice a pattern?

## The Decision
As I said in the heading of this article, we are a current ZoomInfo customer. The only thing that made this a hard decision was the price tag. I don't think that it was outrageous, one large sale would pay for it, but its hard to cough up a large chunk of change for something that you don't really understand and can't verify in the demos. I am referring to the intent side of things. [The Demo][1] article outlines this in greater detail, but in summary, I can't tell you how it works and I can't tell you if it works and that's what is scaring me.

Lets find out....
