# ZoomInfo Intent Review

## What is Intent?
If a company has "Intent" that means that they are looking to buy your product or service.

## How To See Intent
The first things is to head over to the Intent page in the application. There is a button that will take you there in the navigation bar at the top of the page.
<CenteredImage image={navBarIntent} altText={'Caines Head Beach'} width={'h-1/2'} height={'w-2/4'} />

The first thing I have found that works is to start setting filters. Without filters you will get companies from unwanted geographic locations.

This is why my mindset needed to shift. I had always thought:
1. Find the Company
2. Find the decision maker at that company

Instead, I now think: I want to find someone who I think is a decision maker at a company that is interested in my product or service. To do this, I look at all of the contacts for all of the companies interested in my service. Then take that list down only I.T. professionals. Now I look at the contacts, do some research on the company, then try to get a hold of them.

## Is This Data Accurate?
I have no idea if this data is accurate. I am not really sure there is any way that I could verify that it is.
