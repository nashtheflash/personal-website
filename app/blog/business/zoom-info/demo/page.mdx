# ZoomInfo Demo

## My Mindset Going In
I was sceptical, I have been involved in three other demos from some of the other businesses in the space, and they were awful. I can't remember what the companies where, but both demos went about the same way:
* First salesperson calls and claims that they can know when companies are looking to use my service.
* I say that would be amazing. Who wouldn't want to know that?
* The second demo completely flops. I have a very niche business.


I expected nothing different from ZoomInfo. I was locked into work and accidentally missed the first demo, The guy didn't even call to see if I could join. I know that is my fault and a bad look, but hey, I'm trying to run a business here. The deal fizzled until a different sales person gave me a call, and setup a demo.

## The Demo
I was blown away. I through everything at the guy to see if I could find a hole in the system. I couldn't. The demo was split into a couple of different sections or, in my mine, value propositions.

### Finding Intent
Intent was the buzz word that was being through around a lot in the demo. It is the most valuable thing that ZoomInfo is offering my company. They claim that they can tell if people are looking for your product or service. My company provides:
* A B2B service
* A service that almost every company will need at some point, but not frequently.
* The service we provide isn't something that you would search for in your free time. 
* I hate to be that vague, but I don't want everything on the internet. 

 If they can really tell what companies are looking for the service. It's a game changer. It is also the scariest think to me when evaluating this product because it is a complete black box. I can't verify what they are telling me is true, and the tech that would need to be in place is out of my comprehension. I am essentially believing everything that these sales guys are saying. In my experience, salespeople stretch the truth.  

I think that if you were running an e-commerce company, this would be far less valuable. For example, I love Knockaround sunglasses and usually get a few pairs every year, but I shop around. Trying to capture that info and actually use it would be a nightmare. 

### Finding Contacts
He was easily able to pull up the personal information of past coworkers at all different sizes of company. Right out of college I got a job with Kiewit, which has about 20k Employees. They had no issue finding my old manager with his cell phone number. My most recent employer, a company of about 15 employees was listed extremely accurately, even the developers info was correct. They don't contact customers of even the outside world. I have no idea how they are able to collect that information. No this is me just asking them to find people that I know, and does not necessarily mean that there info is good enough to track down the correct contacts of potential customers. It seems really good though.

A side note to this, our billing department immediately loved this. You can just go to a company, and find people in there accounting department. 

## We'll Think About it
Why? Two things, the intent data outlined above and it's expensive. I wont go into specifics, but if it was 5k, I would have given them my card number. So what did we do?\
