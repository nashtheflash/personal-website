# ZoomInfo Week One Implementation

## Day One
First thing in the moring I jumped in the system and was greated with some setup steps. The firs thing was to connect ZoomInfo with out CRM, Zoho. The connection wend smoothly. Then I was asked to setup the intent topics, which to me is the most caluable bpart of the system. I ran into a few issues. I went to the page that allows you to edit or remove the topics and there were already some default topics selected. Not a prolem, I just need to get them changed, when I tried to delete all of the topices, I was met with an error:

Not a problem, I'll remove the cluster. Well, that didn't work either:

At this time it was around 10am, I figured that I would contact my account manager. I was able to track down his email in the app and sent him an email. Long story short, I sent about 20 emails out to multipal people, all of which said that they could not help. The only path forward was to schedule and wait for our implementation meeting on Thursday. This was Monday and I am sitting here ready to use this thing.

The last person I expected to help in this situation was my salesperson, but to his credit, he jumped in and tried to fix the issue that was preventing me from setting up the system. I could tell by his emails that he thought that it was user error, shich is fine and probably very likly, but that changed at some point. It seems there is an error in the system that a software developer is going to need to take a look at. I guess I will wait.
