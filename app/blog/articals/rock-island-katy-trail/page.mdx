<TLDR
text="The Rock Island and Katy Trail rail to trail system crosses the state of Missouri connecting Kansas City and St. Louis. Stretching about 300 miles, the trail crosses small towns, is well maintained, and reserved only for bikes and foot traffic."

## Planning
I had a lot of initial thoughts about how I would plan the route for this trip. I ended up with a goal to ride from my house in Olathe, Kansas to Gateway National Park with a "complete as much as makes sense mindset". I found a couple of useful tools when planning the trip. The first being the old faithful [How Far Did I Run?][1] website. The second and more trip specific is the [The Katy Trail and Rock Island Trail Website][2]. I am not sure who maintains this but it is pretty cool!

I decided taking 143rd east through south Kansas City to Pleasant Hill where Rock Island trail begins would be my best bet. Then I could ride straight through to the Katy and onto St. Louis where I would exit at the [Missouri Bluffs Trail Trailhead][3] and follow Google Maps to Gateway National Park.

The biggest assumption, that fortunately ended up being correct, was that there were enough towns with water, food, camping scattered along the way and no other plan was needed other than the classic "ride until your tired".

I left Thursday May 1st and noon and needed to be on the Sunday trail leaving from St. Louis at 3pm.

## The Trail
The trail is about 8ft wide and consists of finely crushed gravel. The trail is mostly elevated, I assume this is due to it being an old rail line, and has a nice crown that helps shed water quickly. The week prior to my trip was rainy and I was worried this would be an issue. Fortunately, the trail was mostly dry and rode fast. Some soggy sections slowed me down a little but was more than manageable!

I rode gravel bike (Salsa Warbird) and it was fantastic. I think a gravel bike would be the best choice but you could take anything on this trail. I say a lot of cheap e-bikes running round that were doing fine!

## Wildlife
I saw a fair amount of wild life on this trip! Deer, turtles, snakes, spiders, lizards and more! A few notable interactions:

On day one I saw a massive spider while I was riding. I got a little closer than I should and this thing jumped 6-8 inches in the air and almost landed on my leg. Later this was confimed this was a wolf spider. Keep some room between these guys.

After dark on day one I turned on my light and not 5 minuts later I almost ran over a black snake stretched across the trail. If it wasn't for the light I would have it hit. I probably did about 4 total hours or night riding and was very glad to have a bright head light.

On Saturday night I was ridding by headlight and saw lots of opossums and armadillos. It was nice to have some company!


## Traffic
Everyone has a different idea of what isolated means. There were defiantly times where I didn't see many people, but I never felt isolated on the trip. However the trail was hardly ever busy. The buisies sections were near Pleasant Hill, Sedailia, Jeff City, and St.Louis.

## Camping
I wasn't able to find much information on camping before the trip. 

It might seem tempting to walk off the trail and camp but I probably wouldn't. There are tons of ticks! I found out how bad the ticks can get while working for the Missouri DNR in college. However, I would camp at almost any trail head. I think the more away from town the better. I don't know the legality of this, but If you pitched as the sun was going down I don't think you would have an issue.

## Safety
I think the main danger is having something go wrong with your bike causing you to have to limp in or walk to the next town. Almost all of the people I saw were clearly out for an evening walk, riding the trail, or maintenence workers. I did see one "character" out mushroom hunting that I wasn't looking to hang out with for any amount of time and another very strange man at the Coopers Landing campsite that was most likely on drugs.

Overall this is a very safe activity, but I always carry bear spray!

## Weather
I wouldn't do this trip in the heat. 

## Olathe -> Windsor
My mindset was to not push to hard and ride in the dark a little if needed and that is exactly what happened. The trip started with some rode riding and ended at the eastern termulus of the Rock Island trail. This is a fun section. Some of the road riding was on the sholder of Highway 150 wich might make some people uncomfortable and deffinatly is not my favrorit type off riding. It was nessisary to get to the trailhead. 

There is a night path on the north side of Highway 150 that streatched most of te route and got me off of the shoulder.

I ended in Windsor with plans to camp at the trailhead. Google Maps brought up a camp ground and I decided to take a look. Wile standing over my bike looking at the sign, I was approached by the owner. The allure of a shower and coffee in the morning got the best of me. I usually pass on $20 to camp but this place is worth it. The owner is supper nice, the facilities are clean, and they go above and beyond what is expected. Defiantly a place I recommend!

## Windsor -> Coopers Landing	
The day started with a shower and when I was putting my sock back on it ripped. Little did I know that this would end up setting the timeline for the rest of the trip.

I rode into sedalia, got coffe and some food, and went to the bike shop to get a new set of socks.

I rode into Coopers Landing and did infact have a great time and slurped down a couple of beers.

## Coopers Landing -> Chesterfield
I got to pay the price for an easier Friday.

## Chesterfield -> Gateway National Park
I was worried about sorness but this eneded up not being an issue. This ended up being a blissful ride trough some beautiful parts of St. Louis.
