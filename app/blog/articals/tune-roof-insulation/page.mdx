# Inspiration
This post was heavily inspired by [Noah Noah's Post][1] on the Tune Owners group on Facebook.

I was very skeptical that these panels were going to make the camper hold heat any better. I was willing to spend the money in hopes this would help reflect heat in the summer & make the camper darker. All 3 panels together weight 5LBS and are not noticeable when manipulating the roof.

# Materials
You will see that I did not include the Reflective Insulation that Noah had on his build. I did this because I choose to use foam panels that already had a reflective backing. I was hopping this would make the build a bit cheaper with little to no performance loss.

# Tools
Only minimal tools are needed for this build:

Borrow as much as you can! This is a quick project and probably not worth buying any tools unless you have another project in mind. The Hot Knife was defiantly the best way to get a straight cut on the foam. If I was only going to by one tool, it would be that one!

# Build
### Measure & Cut Foam
The front and back alcoves in the Tune M1 Celling measure approximately 70 1/4" x 35 3/4" and the middle alcove is 70 1/4" x 36 3/5". I made some extra cuts to alleviate some of the pressure on the locking mechanism and to make room for the roof port wiring. You can see more exact measurements below that included the fan section.

<CenteredImage image={measurements} altText={'Tune M1 Insulation Carpet'} title={'No Backing'} width={'500'} height={'500'} />
You will needs one 4x8 Sheet of plastic for each indent. If you have a longer truck this may very!

At this point I cut and test fitted all of the panels. I tried both a hot knife and a rotorry tool and bother worked well to make the cuts. A box cutter would take longer but work just the same!
### Install Reflective Insulation
Originally done in Noah's post but I opted to save some time and money and not do this step. I bought foam panels with a reflective backing in hopes it would keep some of the heat out!

### Install Carpet
When buying the carpet, make sure that it does not have a backing material. This will make the panels way heavier and the adhesive wont work at well!

</TwoColumn>

Unroll the carpet and stick the panels to it! Once everything was bonded together, I cut the carpet to fit! I found that laying everything on the foam offcuts and using scissors worked the best!

### Install Velcro
Install both sides of the Velcro on the backs of the panels. I did 3 strips per panel. With the Velcro stuck together, peel the adhesive backing off of the top side of the exposed Velcro. That will stick the Velcro on the perfect place during the first install!

### Install Panels
Just push and hold so the Velcro adhesive has time to bond. The Velcro makes them easily removable in the future!

# Testing
The panels only add minimal performance increases over the stock roof in cold weather conditions. You can read more here: [Tune Cold Wether Performance][7]
The camper was noticeably darker after installing the panels. A plus if that's what you into!

The only other thing to note is that there was an adhesive smell for a few days coming from the panels. I would recommend letting them air out before spending the weekend in the camper!
