## Steps In Planning A Trip
1. Identify The Current River Speed
1. Entry and Exit Point
2. Know the

## Find The River CFS
The speed that a river is moving is measured in cubic feet per second(CFS). The current readings for the Kansas River are shown below.

* Min CFS
* Novice paddles should use the river when the CFS is less than 5,000
* Experience paddles should use the river when the CFS is less than 8,000

## Know The Hazards
The Kansas River has all of the natural hazards that could be found on any river, but also has additional man-made hazards. Those hazards are:

* Low-Head Dams
* Weirs
* Sand Dredges
* Old Railroad Bridges

Want to see descriptions, pictures, and videos of each hazard on the Kansas River?
[Kansas River Hazard Information][1]

### Sand Dredges
When starting to get on the river these were the most concerning because there is little to no information out there about these. The Friends of the Kaw website states: 

**Sand Dredge. Watch for a cable crossing the river that connects the dredge to both banks. The cable should be lowered upon approach by boaters.**

* Is this 24/7? -> 
* Will thy see me in my Kayak? -> 
* Can I just go over these? -> 

### Low Head Dams & Weirs
You should never ride over low head dams or weirs. There are big signs on the Kansas Rivers marking portages around the obstacles.

### Old Railroad Bridges
There are two railroad bridges that were demolished into the river. Both are located in Topeka and are about 2 miles from each other.

## Plan Entry and Exit Points
Deciding where to enter and exit the river depends on how much time you have. Plan on being able to travel 3 miles per hour when the river is < 5,000 CFS and 6 miles per hour if speeds are between 5,000 and 8,000.
