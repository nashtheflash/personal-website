# Kansas River Hazards

Lists and descriptions of all the hazards found on the Kansas River. This list should be complete, but assume that it is not. Always evaluate each obstacles with the current river conditions.

## Low Head Dams & Weirs
You should never ride over low head dams or weirs. There are big signs on the Kansas Rivers marking portages around the obstacles.

### Belvue Low Head Dam
Approximately 8 miles downriver from the Wamego access ramp.

This is a rock low-head dam used to divert water into the water intake structure for the Jeffrey Energy Center.  Note that this is considered a partial low head-dam because it doesn’t extend across the entire river. It extends from the right bank, across the point of the island, and over halfway across the left channel of the river.  Stay on river left to avoid this structure.

This area can be hazardous in low water and paddlers should proceed with caution.  If you see rocks sticking up through the water, avoid them.  Do not paddle close to them as the dam will be just below the surface of the water.  It would be very dangerous to entangle your boat or yourself in this structure.  Even if you do not see any rocks or obstructions, stay on river left to avoid potential problems. 

Here is a video of the approach:

### Topeka Water Plant Low-Head Dam
This is a Low-head Dam and you should not go over it in and vessel. Portage the dam or utilize the paddler shute on the north bank / river left.

The Topeka water plant has a low-head dam (often referred to as the Topeka weir) about 2/3 mile downstream from the U.S. 75 bridge.  **YOU SHOULD NOT GO OVER THE DAM IN ANY VESSEL**.  There are two wide concrete access ramps on the north (river left) side of the river, one above the dam and one below the dam, where paddlers can portage.  There is a large gravel parking lot at the ramps, allowing river users to park cars for shuttling and to launch boats both upstream and downstream. In 2021, a paddler’s chute and fish ladder were installed on the north bank (river left) between the two access ramps, allowing paddlers to continue through this section of the river without portaging.

### Tecumseh Low-Head Dam
**THIS AREA OF THE RIVER IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NOVICE PADDLERS**. This is a challenging area to navigate and should only be paddled by those with extensive river experience.

    <div className="grow min-w-fit">
        * River Mile: 76.0

In low water the bridges can be hazardous and paddlers should proceed with caution.  If you see parts (pipe, iron, railroad ties, etc.) sticking up through the water, avoid them.  Do not paddle close to them as they are attached to the old bridge and parts of it may be just below the water.  It would be dangerous to entangle your boat or yourself in this structure.  Even if you do not see any obstructions, they may be just below the water’s surface.  Paddling past the bridge on the right (south) bank is the best option.

This is a rock low-head dam used to divert water for the Lawrence Energy Center.  Note that this is considered a partial low-head dam because it doesn’t extend across the entire river. It is  located on river left extending halfway into the river.  The purpose is to push water to the Lawrence Energy Center water intake structure.  Stay on the river right to avoid the rock low-head dam.

This area can be hazardous in low water and paddlers should proceed with caution.  If you see rocks sticking up through the water, avoid them.  Do not paddle close to them as additional rocks are just below the water’s surface.  It would be very dangerous to entangle your boat or yourself in this structure.  Even if do not see any rocks or obstructions, stay on river right to avoid potential problems.

### Bowersock Dam
This is a dam and you should not go over in any vessel. All portage should be completed via land on the north bank(river left).

<TwoColumn>
    <div className="grow min-w-fit">
        * River Mile: 52.4
        * GPS: –38.97534, -95.23532

The dam is one mile below Burcham Park (river right and not recommended for use) and 1.7 miles below Lawrence Riverfront Park (river left). The dam is owned by the City of Lawrence and operated by Bowersock Mills and Power Company.  It is used to generate hydroelectric power and to maintain the pool level for the City of Lawrence drinking water intake, which is upstream.  Most paddlers traveling downriver take boats out at Lawrence Riverfront Park above the dam and launch again on the Kansas at the Lawrence Riverfront Park East/8th Street Access Ramp. This requires a shuttle vehicle.  A small, steep, gravel kayak/canoe takeout exists just above the dam on river left.  Paddlers can take out at that point, portage around the dam and north powerhouse, and put back onto the Kansas River on the east side of the powerhouse.  This involves a steep climb to the top of the levee, a 200-yard walk to the put-in location, and a steep descent on gravel back down to river level.

### WaterOne Low Head Dam
This is a dam and you should not go over in any vessel. All portage should be completed via land on the north bank(river left).

<TwoColumn>
    <div className="grow min-w-fit">
        * River Mile: 14.8
        * GPS: 39.04685, -94.78718

This is a rough, 100+ yard portage that requires carrying boats over large, loose rocks that provide precarious footing. (Wheels and carts are not helpful.) At low water levels, you can take out just above the dam onto the stable rock bank; at high flows when the water is flowing over the dam, you must take out onto a slick mud bank safely upstream.

**AVOID THE LOW WATER NOTCH ON RIVER RIGHT NEAR THE SOUTH BANK**. Do not attempt to go over the dam or through the water notch. Portage this dam on river left only. There is no other portage access.  **Currents in this area are dangerous, so use caution**.

## Sand Dredges
Sand Dredge. Watch for a cable crossing the river that connects the dredge to both banks. The cable should be lowered upon approach by boaters.
