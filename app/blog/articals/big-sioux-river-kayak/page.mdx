I was visiting my monther, a resedent of Sioux Falls, in April of 2025. I decided to bring my Packraft. Why? Durring a previous visit, I was walking her dog and noticed some people kayaking down a river in Tuthill park. It stuck, and Easter weeked 2025 was the stars alighed to see what the river was like.

## Goal
The goal of the afternoon was to kayak from Elmwood Park to Falls Park. It just seemed like a good distance and not much though was put into it. Kayaking through down town Sioux Falls did sound like a good time though!

## Research
<TwoColumn>
<div>
Basically nothing. I found this map, which is great if you wanted to view the entire river system not a great for a quick and percics city trip. Imaging my mom: 
where will I drop you off? 
Where will I pick you up?
How long will this take?
Will you die?

All great questions. I shared my location on my phone and headed off.

One other thing I looked at is this all trails track. I don't know that this did much, but I did use it to be able to judge some dstances to try to come up with a ball park of how long this was going to take. You can see this on all trails [here][1]

## Flow
Check the flow before you go! I did not. I could find anything on the internet recommending a minimum flow for rafting. Here were the stats when I went:

* Skunk Creek: 33.2 CFS                                           -- Considered Average
* Big Sioux River at Sioux Falls: 43.9 CFS                        -- Considered Much Below Average
* Big Sioux River at North Cliff Ave at Sioux Falls, SD: 398 CFS  -- Considered Below Average

The above numbers were not heigh enough. There were some portions that needed to be walked and lots of dragging on the bottom. I would consider the above numbers the minimum in order to have some kind of a good time!

You can check the current flow [here][2]!
