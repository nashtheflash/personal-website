# Action Packer Review
I love ActionPackers. I use them primarily for camping and keeping things organized.

<CenteredImage image={actionPakerMountains} altText={'Hotel Picture'} width={'h-1/3'} height={'w-1/3'} />

## The Important Features
1. **Rugged**
I have had these fall off the back of my flatbed and be fine.

2. **Water Resistance**
You cant submerge them, but in my experience leaving them in the rain is completely fine.

3. **Lockable**
I don't use this feature a ton but could be handy in some situations. The main issue that I see is that someone could just walk off with the entire box.

4. **Looks**
They look way better than the standard tubs

## Sizing
There are a few different sizes that you can go with.

**The 8 gallon**
I use the 8 gallon to hold chain lube, oil, and lubricants that I don't want to spill everywhere.

**The 24 gallon**
The 24 gallon is the most versatile box. It's big enough to hold almost anything but not to big to pick up. It is also the biggest size that will fit on airplanes. You can see how I modified mine for flight here -> [Flying with an ActionPacker][1]

**The 35 gallon**
The 35 gallon is big. I would plan to leave this stationary or maybe in the back of a car. If you need something this large, I would probably go with the 35 gallon wheeled version.

**The 35 gallon Wheeled**
The 35 gallon with wheels is a good option to go with because you get a bigger box that is still easy to move around. My buddy has one of these that has all of his standard car camping gear in and he loves it!

**The 48 gallon Wheeled**
This is the big dog. I would only buy this one if I was planning to keep it in a vehicle.  This is the only ActionPacker that I have not seen in person!

## Create A Versatile Storage System
The best way that I have found to utilize that ActionPacker is for consistent and repeatable storage solution. Pick any activity, pick any vehicle, the ActionPacker holds the gear.
* **Car Camping** tent, sleeping pads, lighter, hatchet, cups, box of wine ect... Are all going to be in the box.
* **Climbing** I usually though most of my gear in the ActionPacker and sort out who will carry what at the trailhead.
* **Mountain Biking** helmet, pads, gloves, small tool kit, ect... At the trailhead, I grab the box and am able to get ready without climbing all over the car.
* **Insert Other Activity** whatever activity you are involved in, this aproch can be adopted.

The other great thing is that if you take you buddy's car, or maybe you meet up and get on a boat, or maybe you get on a commercial airplane nothing changes. Just move the box! 

You really cant beat the action packer, and I can't recommend it enough!
