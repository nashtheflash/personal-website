# How to Hike Caines Head
**You can get stuck out at Caines Head!** You must look at the tides to plan the day and time of day at your hike. This article will show you how to do that. Zero experience necessary. Your safety is your responsibility! This article is written from my point of view. All times are based on my fitness level and my level of experience in the Alaskan backcountry.

## Finding the Tide Chart.
You need the tide char for Resurrection Bay. Here it is:
<LinkNewTab text='Resurrection Bay Tide Chart' link='https://www.usharbors.com/harbor/alaska/seward-resurrection-bay-ak/tides/'/>

## Pick a Day
The Sate of Alaska recommends that you only hike to Cains Head if the low tide it less than +3. Looking at the below chart, lets pick an acceptable day.

<CenteredImage image={tideChart} altText={'Resurrection Bay Tide Chart'} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

We hiked this on Saturday the 8th and started at 6am. We choose this day and time because if you look at the **Low Tide** column. Then at the **AM** column for the 8th, you will see that it says 9:30am -2.3. That means the tide will be the lowest at 9:30am and will start to rise starting at 9:31. The -2.3 means that it will 2.3 lower than a normal tide. Keep in mind that this needs to be below +3. Saturday the 8th is a great day to pick!

Lets look at a day that this hike would not be recommended, Thursday the 14th. In this case, low tide is at 12:48Am and is +3.7. This would be over +3 and not hikeable.

## Pick a Time
You don't want to leave at low tide, you want to leave before. Here are a few other considerations:
* The only miles effected by the tide are miles 3-5
* In a perfect world, as soon as the route is available you would start hiking.
* When you start walking down the beach note the water level, time, and the time until low tide.

With that in mine, take a look at the below chart:

<CenteredImage image={trailMap} altText={'Cains Head Map'} width={'h-2/3'} height={'w-2/3'} />

I would try to get to Tonsina Point at least 2 hours before low tide. That gives you about a 4 hour window to go out and back. The trail to Tonsina Point is easy, its a paved road that leads to a well beat trail. If you are hiking, no running at all, I would budget 30min to get to Tonsina Point. Keep in mind that's a perfect world. If there is a Moose standing in the middle of the trail its going to take longer. Alternatively, I would not think twice about biking this section. A mountain bike or my "leave in the woods bike" would work fine.

If you looked at the water level when you left, you have a **Ball Park** of what you can expect on the way back. It it looks good 2 hours before low tide, it will probably look good 2 hours after. Remember, your safety is your responsibility, have a plan if something weird happens. What are you going to do if a bear is sitting on the beach on the way back?

## Planning
I have always wanted to do Cains Head. My girlfriend and I wanted a weekend in Seward and a Cains Head Hike would be a good amount of activity for a relaxing weekend. We checked the tide for the following day. It looked like good conditions so we planned to leave the trailhead at 6:30am. We went to bed after a bit to much wine.

## Hiking
We woke up feeling better than expected, hit the <LinkNewTab text='Seward Cup' link='https://www.facebook.com/people/Sewards-Cup/100046372670867/'/> and drove to the trailhead. It was colder than expected and I had to bring my puffy that I knew would be word for the first mile. We made Tonsina Point quickly with a little running. When we When I say the water it was lower than expected, we probably could have been an hour earlier but were happy with that amount of time that we had. We started down the beach which went from smooth to rock to smooth. The beach backs up to a wall where there had been some slides. We were accompanied by bald eagles and seals out playing in the shallow water. At this point, you really could not have asked for a better day.

## The Fort
After navigating the beach we made our way up to the fort. It was cool, but also a little unsettling. I would rather be deep in a cave then in dark underground abandoned military facilities. I was able to see all I wanted from the entrance. The signs that the state put out there were actually really interesting. I knew that the fort was up there, but had no idea there was an underwater submarine detector installed in the middle of Resurrection Bay. Apparently it is still there today. After taking in the scene we headed to South Beach.

## South Beach to Derby Cove
South Beach is a cool area, but not to terribly big. Great view of the open ocean. The trail to Derby Cove had more elevation to it than I was expecting. There were also a few beautiful waterfalls which were also not expected. I was hesitant to do this section but was glad we did in the end. We had to navigate some snow on the top of the pass but nothing crazy. It might have added 20min to our time. That is my big gripe with this hike, you always felt that you were racing the clock. At the top of the pass we saw that we were running close on time so ran most of the way down. We made the beach and after seeing where the water was I knew that we were going to make it back, but we needed to say on the gas.

## Back to the Truck
We made it down the back to Tonsina Point with time to spare, took a few minutes to take in the view and headed back to the truck. I was ready for a $30 burger shake combo and was also in the mood to get treated like garbage so I went to <LinkNewTab text='Reds' link='https://www.facebook.com/redsburgers/?rf=387334457983617&_rdr'/>. A place that many of my adventures out of Seward have ended and my favorite place to hate on. There burgers are good, otherwise I wouldn't be back.
